Tamil Nadu Levy of Ryotwari Assessment on Freehold Lands Act, 1972(Tamil Nadu
Act 31 of 1973)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Levy of Ryotwari
Assessment on Free-hold Lands Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1973). - Since
the year 1859, certain lands are held free from demand of land revenue after
payment of twenty times the annual assessment due on them or on concessional
rate of assessment. These lands are called free-hold lands. These lands are
only ryotwari lands with the difference that while the owners of other
ryotwari lands are liable to pay the annual assessment fixed for-the land, the
owners of free-hold lands are not liable to pay any assessment or are liable
to pay concessional rate of assessment only. The free-holders are situated in
almost all the districts in the State. Whatever may be the justification for
the grant of these lands as freeholds in the past on the basis of some
capitalisation of the assessment, there is not justification to permit the
present owners of the land to hold the lands as free-holds indefinitely. The
Government have, therefore, decided to abolish all free-holds in the State, so
that these lands can come under the normal ryotwari pattern of paying annual
revenue with cess, etc.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decision.Published in Part IV-Section 3, page 520 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 4th December 1972.Received the assent of the
