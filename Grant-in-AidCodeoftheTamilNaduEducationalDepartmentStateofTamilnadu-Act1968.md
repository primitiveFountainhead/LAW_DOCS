will be given impartially and without reference to any religious instructions
to all schools which impart sound, secular instruction, subject to the
conditions hereinafter specified and with due consideration of the
requirements of each locality, and of each institution and of the funds
available:Provided that grants shall be withheld from institutions which
refused admission to any pupil merely on the ground of the caste or community
to which he belongs, provided also that no grant of any kind shall be paid to
a new institution or in respect of a new department or course in an existing
institution which has been opened without the previous consent of the
director.These rules do not apply to Anglo-Indian Schools or to Primary

excite feelings of political disability or disaffection among the

of an objection being upheld, the management concerned may be called upon to
refund the amount paid of such portion of it as the Government may decide.

school or in such other manner as the Government may deem fit.(iv)In cases
where the managements of aided educational institutions (other than primary
schools) do not pay dearness allowance at Government rates to the staff under

position of the institutions and if, after such investigation, he is satisfied
that the managements can afford to pay the allowance at Government rates shall
direct the managements concerned to pay the allowance at Government rates. If
even after the issue of such a direction, the managements receiving grants
from State funds do not pay the allowance at Government rates, the grant
payable to them may be withheld either in full or in part. The refusal of the
payment of the allowance at Government rates by managements which do not earn

benefaction of the construction or purchase of a building or acquisition of
land for an educational institution, it shall be entitled to take full credit
for such benefaction in arriving at its' share of the cost of the
construction, or purchase of the buildings or acquisition of land and where
the private benefaction is in excess of the Management's share of the cost,
such excess shall be taken as deduction of the State Government's share of the
cost.(G. O. Ms. No. 2095, Education, dated the 8th September 1953)Before
making payment, the Director will require the management to furnish the
certificates referred to in rule 53(ii) or will obtain the valuation referred
to in rule 53(iii), as the case may be, showing the actual amount expended by
them in completing the work, purchase or acquisition and, if necessary, he may
call for the vouchers at any time in support of the expenditure incurred.He
may also require the management to furnish a certificate specifying the total
amount of private benefactions received in respect of the work.[The building
schemes of the aided colleges which are already aided by the Government of
India or the University Grants Commission or other agency will not be eligible
for State Government Grant.] [The paragraph was added by G. O. R. No. 2213,
Education, dated the 9th October 1973.]

### 56. Claims of the Government.

educational purposes approved by the Government within a period of thirty
years from the date of payment of the grant, where the grant does not exceed
fifty thousand rupees, fifty years from the date of payment of the grant where
the grant exceeds fifty thousand rupees but does not exceed one lakh and 99
years from the date of payment of the grant where the grant exceeds one lakh
of rupees. The amount to be refunded shall bear the same proportion to the
total grant as the unexpired portion of the period for which the building or
land is secured against diversion bears to the total period. If the manager
fails to make such refund, the Government may recover the amount by such means
as they think fit.

Appendix LL(Chapter VIII, rule 52)Instructions As To The Sanitary and Hygienic
Requirements To Be Observed In The Designing and Construction of School
Buildings In The State of Tamil NaduSelection of SitesIn the selection of
site, the following points should be weighed against considerations, economy
convenience, proximity to houses of parents, etc.: -(i)A site should not be
selected if its natural position is in a hollow or in the neighbourhood of
high trees, or houses which prevent the free circulation of air and the access
of sunlight to the school buildings. Shady trees are, however, of value, in
the playground, provided that they do not unduly reduce the space available
for play and are not planted so close to the school buildings as to obstruct
the entry of light into the class rooms, or in course of time, to cause damage
to the structure.(ii)Made soil should be avoided and, as far as possible, all
soils which are specially retentive of moisture.(iii)Sufficiency of space is
important, and in this connection, the possibility of future extension and the
necessity of giving subsequent class rooms, the proper orientation should be
born in mind.(iv)Channels and tanks in the vicinity are a disadvantage.(v)The
presence of rank vegetation, more especially prickly, pear, is
objectionable.(vi)The neighbourhood of trusty and noisy roads and of shops or
factories should of far as possible, be avoided.

### 2\. All site plans should show the nature of the surroundings, the height
of the neighbouring buildings, the north point and the direction of the
prevailing wind.

Orientation of Buildings

### 3\. This will differ for different parts of the State and will depend
chiefly on the best way to secure perflation of air. Subject to this the more
buildings are lighted from the north the better.

Floor Space

### 4\. When funds are available, they should be utilized in providing floor
space in excess of the following minimum requirements: -

For Elementary Schools | ... | 0.88 square metres  
---|---|---  
For Secondary Schools |  | 0.99 square metres  
For training colleges and technical schools | ... | 1.40 square metres  
  
Rooms which are intended to be used for practical work, such as laboratories,
drawing room, workshops, etc., should be carefully designed with a view to the
nature of the work and the number of students to be accommodated.Composition
of Floors

### 5\. It is desirable that the floors should be made of a material which
will admit of there being, washed with water. Stone flagging or something
better must be aimed at in rooms where desks or benches can be provided. Where
the pupils have to sit on the floor, stone floors need not be insisted on if
objected to. At the same time, it must be recognized that from the hygienic
point of view, they are to be preferred and objection on the score of their
coldness can be met by providing boards or mats. But where this is done, the
greatest care must be taken to ensure that the mats are kept scrupulously
clean.

Seating Arrangements

### 6\. The general principles which should govern the construction of desks
are set forth in Annexure (I). Where dual desks are used, the desks may be
arranged most suitably as shown in diagram in Annexure (II).

### 7\. Forms without backs and desks are objectionable; type designs for
desks are issued by the department.

### 8\. Pupils should be seated in rows with the main light falling from the
left side, they should never face the light. The same remarks applies to the
teachers.

Windows

### 9\. Windows serve two purposes: -

(a)Admission of light.(b)Admission of air.

### 10\. They should be placed at regular distances so as to ensure uniformity
of light.

### 11\. Window sills should not be more than 12.20 d.m. from the ground in
room in which the scholars are seated at desks. When pupils sit on the floor
the sills should come to within 7.60 d.m. or 9.10 d.m. of the floor level.
Windows for subsidiary lighting may have their sills more than 12.20 d.m. from
the floor.

### 12\. The windows area should not be less than one-fifth of the floor area
and whenever possible the principal lighting should be from the north.

Doors

### 13\. Class rooms should not have to be used as passages from one part of
the building to another. They should consequently not open into one another
but into passages or verandahs. No classroom should have more than two doors
and in most case one is preferable. The door or doors should be at the
teacher's end of the room.

Height of Class Rooms

### 14\. The minimum height of the rooms in Secondary

|  Height between floor level to the bottom of floorslab or roof slab |  Height between floor level to the bottom of thebeam in the case of sloped roof  
---|---|---  
1\. Single storeyed building having terraced orsloped roof | 36.60 d.m | 33.55 d.m.  
2\. Double storeyed building having both groundfloor and first floor terraced or first floor with sloping roof. |  36.30 d.m. below floor in ground floor and 33.55d.m. between floors in the first floor. |  Height of bottom of the beam from top of floorin the case of sloping roof in first floor -33.55 d.m.  
  
In the case of Elementary Schools, the height of room should be 10 to the
bottom of the beam in the case of sloping roof and 11" upto the underside of
the roof slab in the case of terraced roof.(G. O. Ms. No. 1454, Education,
dated the 17th August 1964)Ventilation

### 15\. Unless there are windows reaching to the top of the wall and capable
of being opened, ventilators are necessary near the top of the wall. The
ventilators should be regularly distributed in the same way as the windows.
For each pupil, 48 square inches of open ventilator should be provided.

Dimensions and Fittings of Classrooms

### 16\. It is important that no school or class room should be more than 7.30
metres in width or otherwise the rows of pupils will be too long to be
properly controlled by the teacher. The length of a room must depend on the
number of classes to be held in it. In the case of a school divided into a
number of class rooms, the dimensions of any room should not exceed 7.30
metres x 7.60 metres, that is, an approximate square. If it is admitted that a
square is the best area for teaching purposes, the length of a class room in a
one roomed school should, approximately, be close to some multiple of the
width. Ample wall black-board, space should be provided especially on the wall
at the teachers' end of the room which should be unbroken by door's windows or
cup-boards. Cup-board recesses in other walls should be provided also recesses
with open shelving. Rails under the cornice for hanging maps, pictures and
diagrams are essential. The smallest class room for 40 boys in dual desks
should be 6.40 metres wide and 7 metres long. The arrangement of such a room
is shown in the enclosed diagram No. C. A. 306 of 1917 Annexure (II). To
accommodate similarly desks of larger dimensions, those of the room must be
proportionately increased.

Roofs

### 17. The roof should, as far as possible, be impervious to heat.

Sanitary Arrangements

### 18. Latrines should not be placed nearer than 12 metres, to any school
building. They should be so situated that the prevailing wind will not blow
from them in the direction of the school.

### 19. The type designs of the sanitary department should be consulted when
planning latrines.

### 20. For boy's schools, separate urinals and latrines should be provided.
Separate accommodation should, in all schools, be provided for the teaching
staff.

### 21. The number of latrine seats should be on the following scale: -

| Girls | Boys |  | Girls | Boys  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Under 30 children | 2 | 1 | Under 150 children | 6 | 3  
Under 50 children | 3 | 2 | Under 200 children | 8 | 4  
Under 70 children | 4 | 2 | Under 300 children | 12 | 5  
Under 100 children | 5 | 3 | Under 500 children | 20 | 8  
  
### 22. In addition, there should be urinals for boys at the rate of six
urinal compartments each 51 cms. wide for every 100 boys, or if separate
urinals are not provided, the number of latrine seats should be
correspondingly increased.

### 23\. If the flush-out system of latrines is in vogue, the number of water
closets should be on the following scale: -

Number of Scale of water closets Number of Scale of water closets

Number of Pupils | Scale of water closets | Number of Pupils | Scale of water closets  
---|---|---|---  
Girls | Boys | Girls | Boys  
25 | 1 | 1 | 150 | 6 | 3  
50 | 2 | 1 | 200 | 8 | 4  
75 | 3 | 2 | 300 | 12 | 5  
100 | 4 | 2 | 500 | 20 | 8  
  
In addition, provision should be made for urinals at 6 per 100 boys.Annexure
(I)The requirements of suitable desks and seats are that the pupil should sit
with body fairly vertical for writing and be able to lean back for reading
without any danger of curvature of the spine in either case. He should not
stoop or lounge or sit in any way, askew, and the book or paper should rest at
a comfortable distance below his eyes.TableMeasurement in CMs.
