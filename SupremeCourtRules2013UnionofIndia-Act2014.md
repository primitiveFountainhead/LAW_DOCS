matters mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of section 2 of that Act or to any
other matter.

### 2\. A next friend shall not retire without the leave of the Court. The
Court may require him to procure a fit person to be put in his place before he
is permitted to retire, and may also, if it thinks fit, require him to furnish
security for costs already incurred or likely to be incurred as a condition of
his retirement.

### 3\.

(1)On the retirement, removal or death of the next friend of a minor, further
proceedings shall be stayed until the appointment of a new next friend in his
place.(2)Where the advocate-on-record of such minor omits, within a reasonable
time, to take steps to get a new next friend appointed, any person interested
in the minor or in the matter in issue may apply to the Court for the
appointment of one, and the Court may appoint such person as it thinks fit as
the next friend of such minor.

### 4\. An application for the appointment of new next friend of a minor shall
be supported by an affidavit showing that the person proposed is a fit and
proper person to be so appointed and has no interest adverse to that of the
minor.

### 5\. Where a respondent to an appeal or petition is a minor and is not
represented by a guardian, an application shall be made to the Court by the
appellant or petitioner as the case may be, or by some person interested in
the minor for the appointment of a guardian of such minor; and it shall be
supported by an affidavit stating that the proposed guardian has no interest
in the matter in question in the appeal or petition adverse to that of the
minor. Where a person other than the father or where there is no father, the
mother or other natural guardian of the minor is proposed as guardian, notice
of the application shall be served on the father or where there is no father,
on the mother or other natural guardian of the minor, or on the person with
whom the minor resides, not less than fourteen days before the day named in
the notice for the hearing of the application. Where there is no other person
fit and willing to act as guardian, the Court may appoint an officer of the
Court to be guardian. The Court may, in any case, if it thinks fit, issue
notice to the minor also.

### 6\.

(1)No guardian of a minor shall retire from a suit, appeal or other proceeding
without the leave of Court. Where a guardian of a minor fails to do his duty
or other sufficient cause is shown for his removal, the Court may remove him
from the guardianship of the minor and make such order as to costs as it
thinks fit.(2)Where the guardian of a minor retires, dies or is removed by the
Court during the pendency of the suit, appeal or other proceeding, the Court
shall appoint a new guardian in his place.

### 7\. When a guardian ad-litem of a minor respondent is appointed, and it is
made to appear to the Court that the guardian is not in possession of any, or
sufficient funds for the conduct of the appeal or petition on behalf of the
respondent, and that the respondent will be prejudiced in his defence thereby,
the Court may, in its discretion, from time to time, order the appellant or
petitioner, as the case may be, to advance to the guardian of the minor for
the purpose of his defence such moneys as the Court may fix, and all moneys so
advanced shall form part of the costs of the appellant or petitioner in the
appeal or petition, as the case may be. The order shall direct that the
guardian do file in Court an account of the moneys so received by him.

### 8\. An application to declare as a major a party to a proceeding described
as a minor and to discharge his next friend or guardian shall be supported by
an affidavit stating the age of the alleged major and the date on which he
attained majority. Notice of the application shall be given to the next friend
or guardian and to the alleged major.

### 9\. No next friend or guardian of a minor in an appeal or other
proceeding, shall without the leave of the Court, expressly recorded in the
proceedings, enter into any agreement or compromise on behalf of a minor with
reference to the appeal or proceeding in which he acts as next friend or
guardian.

### 10\. An application made to the Court for leave to enter into an agreement
or compromise or for the withdrawal of any appeal or other proceedings in
pursuance of a compromise on behalf of a minor, shall be supported by an
affidavit from the next friend or guardian of the minor stating that the
agreement or compromise is for the benefit of the minor, and, where the minor
is represented by an Advocate, by a certificate or by a statement at the bar
from such advocate to the effect that the agreement or compromise is, in his
opinion, for the benefit of the minor. A decree or order made in pursuance of
the compromise of an appeal or other proceeding, to which a minor is a party,
shall recite the sanction of the Court thereto and shall set out the terms of
the compromise.

### 11\.

(1)No decree passed against a minor shall be set aside merely on the ground
that the next friend or guardian for the appeal, petition or other proceeding
of the minor had an interest in the subject-matter of the appeal, petition or
other proceeding adverse to that of the minor, but the fact that by reason of
such adverse interest of the next friend or guardian for the appeal, petition
or other proceeding, prejudice has been caused to the interests of the minor,
shall be a ground for setting aside the decree.(2)Nothing in this rule shall
preclude the minor from obtaining any relief from this Court available under
any law by reason of the misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the
next friend or guardian for the appeal, petition or other proceeding resulting
in prejudice to the interests of the minor.

### 12\. The provisions of this order, so far as they are applicable, shall
apply to persons adjudged to be of unsound mind and to persons who, though not

is found to be defective, the said document shall, after notice to the party
filing the same, be placed before the Registrar. The Registrar may, by an

being stamped or that the Court-fee paid thereon initially was insufficient,
the Registrar or the Taxing Officer shall record a declaration to that effect
and determine the amount of deficiency in Court fee:Provided that no such

the record, may report to the Court as to the nature of the proceedings and

the record and hearing of the appeal, including directions regarding the time

to be insufficient, the Registrar may issue a summons calling upon him to show
cause before the Court why the appeal should not be dismissed for non-
prosecution.

### 28\. The Registrar shall send a copy of the summons mentioned in the last
specified rule to every respondent who has entered appearance. The Court may,
after hearing the parties, dismiss the appeal for non-prosecution or give such

substituted or entered on the record in place of, or in addition to the party
on record.

in addition to the party on record, and the name of such person shall
thereupon be substituted or entered on the record:

Registrar-(i)where a question arises as to whether any person is or is not the
legal representative of the deceased party, or(ii)where a question of setting
aside the abatement of the cause is involved;and in such a case he shall place
the matter before the Court for orders:Provided further that where during the
course of the proceedings it appears to the Registrar that it would be
convenient for the enquiry that investigation in regard to the person who is
to be substituted on record, be made by the Court appealed from or a Court
subordinate thereto, the Registrar may place the matter before the Judge in
Chambers and the Judge in Chambers may thereupon make an order directing to
the Court appealed from to investigate into the matter either itself or cause
an enquiry to be made by a Court subordinate to it, after notice to the
parties, and submit its report thereon to this Court within such time as may
be fixed by the order. On receipt of the report from the Court below the

proceedings in relation to proceedings in contempt under this Part.
