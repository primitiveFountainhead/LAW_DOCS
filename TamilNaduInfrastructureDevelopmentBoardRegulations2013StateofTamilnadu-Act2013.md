### 9. Value for Money Assessment.

(1)The Value for Money Assessment shall be part of the Feasibility Study of
any Project proposed for implementation through the Public Private Partnership
mode and for other projects where the Board is of the view that such an
assessment is necessary.(2)The primary purpose of a Value for Money assessment
shall be to determine the most appropriate delivery mode for a project and to
assist in the evaluation of tenders received from the private sector
Participants in case of projects implemented in the Public Private Partnership
mode.(3)The Value for Money assessment shall be conducted over different
stages of the project including the project appraisal and approval stage,
evaluation of the tenders and before the final award of tender stage and after
the award of the tender to the successful tenderer.(4)In the feasibility
study, the Value for Money assessment shall in the first instance draw up a
public sector comparator and an estimate of the cost of delivering the project
through the Public Private Partnership mode after specifying clear outputs
from the project, accounting for competitive neutrality adjustment and costing
of transferable risks and retained risks and applying such further guidelines
as the Board may issue from time to time, thereby enabling a comparison of the
risk adjusted life cycle costs of implementing the project directly by the
public agency versus the Public Private Partnership mode of
implementation.(5)At the project appraisal, pre-tender stage, the value for
money assessment will be indicative and a decision of whether or not to go
choose the Public Private Partnership mode of implementation would have to be
supported by a consideration of this assessment as also other qualitative
factors described in Regulation 8.(6)The Public Sector Comparator shall be
updated before the tender stage of a Public Private Partnership project and
the updated public sector comparator may be used as guidance for the following
purposes:(a)For a comparison with the tenders;(b)Negotiation with the lowest
tenderer; and(c)To take a final decision before awarding the tender whether to
implement the project in the Public Private Partnership mode or not.(7)The
Value for Money assessment shall be updated after the issue of the letter of
award to the successful tenderer to enable the benchmarking and monitoring of
Value for Money delivery by the private partner.

### 10. Recommendation of the Board.

(1)On considering the note prepared under clause (5) of regulation 7, the
project concept note and the feasibility study, the Board shall make a
determination as to the feasibility and the desirability of implementing the
project on account of its socio-economic benefits, including the priority of
such implementation vis a vis other projects under its consideration.(2)The
Board shall satisfy itself that all options to increase efficiency in project
scoping have been considered, the same level of service delivery needs cannot
be met with a reduced scope and scale of the Project and that the capital and
operating costs have been optimized and are reasonable;(3)Upon deciding that
the project is feasible and is of priority, the Board shall, subject to the
provisions of regulation 11, make a determination as to whether the public
private partnership mode would be appropriate.(4)The Board shall then
recommend to Government that those projects which are to be implemented in the
public sector mode, those which may be implemented in either mode, and those
which are to be implemented in the public-private partnership mode. Where the
Board recommends the public private partnership mode of implementation, it
shall also indicate the appropriate form of concession agreement to be entered
into from out of those in Schedule II of the Act.(5)In cases where the Board
recommends implementation through the Public Private Partnership mode, it
shall also indicate the possible extent and form of public financial support
that the project may require in accordance with rule 12:Provided that in cases
where the public financial support proposed is from the Central Government,
the sponsoring agency may be advised to approach the appropriate agency of the
Central Government.(6)The Board shall also indicate in its recommendations the
public agency which is to implement the project in the public sector mode, or
which is to be designated as the sponsoring agency for Public Private
Partnership mode of implementation.

### 11. Factors to be considered by the Board in determining whether to
recommend Public Private Partnership implementation.

(1)The Board shall examine the Project Concept Note and the Feasibility Study
and recommend implementation through the Public Private Partnership on a
consideration of the following factors:-(a)The project is of sufficient scale
and with major capital investment over a long-term and the life cycle costs
and revenues of the Project establish the sustainability of the Public Private
Partnership mode throughout the concession period.(b)The value for money
assessment at the pre-tender stage indicates that the Public Private
Partnership mode of implementation is likely to achieve a net present value
higher than public sector comparator.(c)The risk profile of the project is
appropriate for transfer of some risks to a potential private partner.(d)The
allocation of risks between the public agency and the private party
implementing the project is appropriate and implementation through the Public
Private Partnership mode does not pass on abnormally high risk to the public
agency either in terms of direct financial commitments or indirect or
contingent liabilities.(e)An independent assessment of the market demand,
including a comprehensive justification of major assumptions and key findings,
has been made and the project revenues are considered realistic and viable for
the potential private partner;(f)The project has measurable outputs which can
be specified and a performance based agreement can be entered
into;(g)Managerial efficiency can be achieved through better asset utilization
or through more efficient design to meet performance specifications;(h)A
competitive market exists and the use of a competitive process would encourage
private entities to develop innovative means of service delivery while meeting
the Public Agency's cost objectives.(i)User charges projected, if any, are
affordable and acceptable to users and would be socially and economically
acceptable.(j)The tariffs setting and revision framework is predictable and
transparent.(k)The direct financial commitments of the public agency or the
Government or both have been quantified and reasonably estimated for the
entire contract duration and are within the budgetary limits of the Government
or the Public Agency, as the case may be.(l)The Contingent Liabilities,
including guarantees (Corporate or Government) legal obligations and
commitments and implicit obligations including the need to continuously
provide a public service, if any, have been assessed and are acceptable to the
Public Agency.

### 12. Project Implementation by Public Sector Mode.

(1)On receipt of Government's decision to implement a project in the public
sector mode, if the Board is of the view that the information available
regarding the technical, economic, social or financial parameters of the
project are adequate to proceed with the implementation of the project, it
shall inform the designated public agency and direct them to commence
implementation forthwith.(2)In cases where the Board is of the view that the
information is inadequate it may cause further detailed project study covering
all or any specific aspects of the project for which further information is
required and upon being satisfied with the further information provided, it
will direct the designated public agency to commence implementation
forthwith.(3)For the purposes of section 15 of the Act, implementation of the
project will be deemed to have commenced from the date the first tender notice
covering a significant proportion of the project is published:Provided that if
even after three successive tender notices, there is inadequate response and
it has not been possible to finalize the tenders, the Board may decide that
the public agency has not commenced implementation of the project and proceed
to act under sub-section (2) of section 15 of the Act.

### 5\. Performance Management. - (a) To achieve high standards of performance
from the Project including a Public Private Partnership Project, it is vital
to continuously monitor its service delivery and compliance to performance
standards. Therefore, the Public Agency or Sponsoring Agency, through the PMF,
shall put in place requisite performance monitoring mechanisms.

(b)The PMF shall prepare, prior to signing of the Concession Agreement or
contract, a performance management plan as part of Project Management Plan,
such a plan shall, clearly define performance requirements for each stage in
the project life cycle, which shall include:(i)Development requirements
covering the standards of civil and engineering works;(ii)Commissioning
requirements covering testing requirements prior to commissioning of Public
Private Partnership Project;(iii)Service delivery requirements covering output
requirements for efficient service delivery;(iv)Handover requirements which

PMF, shall monitor performance through KPIs, wherein it shall, as part of
performance management framework:(i)Establish reporting and monitoring systems
and procedures,(ii)Define data collection methods and data
sources,(iii)Specify time frames for reporting and monitoring of indicators,
and(iv)Assign responsibilities for reporting and monitoring activities.(d)The
Sponsoring Agency or Public Agency, through the PMF, particularly in long term
Concession Agreements and contracts wherein performance standards for service
delivery are likely to evolve over time, shall establish a system of
continuous improvement in project service delivery. Herein, target indicators
may be based on past performance with an incremental improvement envisaged so
that principles of continuous improvement apply.

### 7\. Risk Management. - (a) Based on the risks identified and allocated
during the procurement and contracting phases, a response plan to risks
materializing shall be prepared by the Procuring Entity. This shall be a set
of possible escalations and actions to be made by the Sponsoring Agency for
managing risks and responding to possible risk outcomes.

(b)This shall include a risk reporting, monitoring and control system for
continuous reporting, monitoring and updating of risks allocated to either
party throughout the project life cycle. And also to establish procedures to
be used by the Sponsoring Agency or Public Agency to deal with failure of the
private party to manage the risk, such as penalties and other suitable
measures, as also contingency procedures to restore service delivery.

### 8\. Contingency Management. - (a) Many of the facilities and services
under the Public Private Partnership Projects will be of an essential nature
and hence would require to be restored to citizens or users at the earliest
possible and even in case of private party failure.

(b)Contingency planning is vital to a Public Private Partnership Project, as
it may not be possible to fully transfer responsibility for the risk of
service delivery failure to the private party. Need for a contingency plan
arises on account of possible service disruption or private party default.
Wherein, contingency can be classified into:(i)Disruption in service delivery
not on account of private party default such as, force majeure
events;(ii)Disruption in service delivery on account of private party default
on contract terms; and(iii)Default by private party but no disruption in
service delivery.(c)In light of this Sponsoring Agency shall cause development
of a Contingency Management Plan. It shall include the following:(i)Business
continuity plan, Its objective is to mitigate the impact of service delivery
disruption on the key stake holders, i.e. contracting parties and end users.
It shall include:(a)Potential events that could disrupt service
delivery;(b)Immediate actions in response to such events;(c)Priority and time
frames for restoring critical services;(d)Service levels for each critical
service;(e)Identified resources for implementing the plan;(f)Allocation of
roles and responsibilities for response management;(g)Information required
implementing the plan;(h)Stakeholder communication; and(i)Periodic testing
requirement, of the plan.(ii)Step-in plan, allows the Procuring Entity, under
exigent circumstances, to "step-in" and temporarily take control of project
facilities to ensure continued service delivery, it shall include:(a)Potential
events that may trigger step in clause of contract;(b)Contractual conditions
to be satisfied before step in;(c)Institutional roles and responsibilities in
implementation of step in clause;(d)Prior authorizations required prior to
exercise of right;(e)Obligations and liabilities incurred in exercising step
in rights;(f)Resources required to implement the plan;(g)Communication to
implement the step in plan; and(h)Whether "step-out" is possible or
feasible.(iii)Default plan, to be implemented when default clause of the
contract is invoked, it shall include:(a)Potential events likely to lead to a
default;(b)Impact of default on service delivery;(c)Time period before
institution can act on the default;(d)Contractual remedies and impact on
service delivery;(e)Institutional roles and responsibilities;(f)Resources
required to implement the plan; and(g)Communication to implement the default
plan.(d)However due process should be observed in invoking these contractual
provisions. Action should be taken keeping in mind the nature of relationship
with the private party.(e)The PMF shall be responsible for carrying out
contingency management activities and monitoring implementation of the
contingent plan.

### 9\. Managing relationship and communication. - (a) It is essential that
there exists mutual trust amidst contracting parties, through open
communication and information sharing. On each side, the roles and
responsibilities of respective Project Management Facility should be
finalized, channels for communication should be clearly set out and
communication should be consistent across levels and under-pinned by a culture
of information sharing and prompt action.

(b)It is important to periodically review the relationship between contracting
parties. The objective of such an exercise should be to identify any issues
that may have arisen during the course of project execution and the resolution
of which has had an impact on the relationship between contracting parties.
Initiating steps to overcome any issues early on will help avoid any
escalation of such issues into larger disputes.(c)It is also important to
conduct periodic one-to-one and group interactions between the project
management facility's of the contracting parties as well as with the users and
societal stakeholders of the project.

### 10\. Dispute Resolution. - (a) Effective measure should be put in place
through the contract to settle disputes between the contracting parties.

(b)Mutual discussions, wherein the parties to the agreement can come together
to discuss a mutually agreeable settlement, is one of the most effective tools
for dispute resolution in terms of management time, cost, range of possible
solution and relationship management and thus it shall be the preferred method
to resolve disputes.(c)Thereafter, Sponsoring Agency or public agency shall
follow the procedures specified in the Concession Agreement to resolve
disputes between parties.(d)It shall be the responsibility of Project
Management Facility to ensure that the dispute resolution procedure laid down
in contract is adhered to and informing contracting parties and all relevant
stakeholders on dispute resolution progress.

(Annuity), ensure timely payments by the authority as set out in the
contract.(c)In case of user fee based Public Private Partnership
Projects:(i)Effective monitoring of revenues earned by the private operator
and collection of revenue share or any other payments due to authority;
and(ii)Ensure timely disbursals of capital or revenue grants (if any) by the
authority.(d)In both types of Public Private Partnership Projects, as
applicable, the process would also involve:(i)Imposition of penalties
(including suspension of revenue collection rights);(ii)Adjustments for
inflation and other factors; and(iii)Develop and implement reporting systems
for the above.(e)The PMF shall ensure that, payment mechanism links payments
to achievement of performance standards set out in the contract, such that
payment mechanism shall:(i)Fully reflect actual service
delivery;(ii)Incorporate a system of penalties such as deductions based on
severity of service failure; and(iii)award penalty points for non-compliance,
leading to contractual remedies taking affect in the event of repeated
offence.

### 13\. Information and knowledge management. - (a) The Project Management
Facility shall be responsible for put in place effective mechanisms for
information and knowledge management. It shall extend to, but not limited to
responsibilities listed herein below:

(i)Identification of information resources;(ii)Capturing, collating,
classifying, storing and appropriate security of information;(iii)Sharing of
information to users, likely users and to those required under any law;
and(iv)Reviewing, maintaining and pursuing of information to meet contractual
compliance requirement.(b)To ensure continuous availability of project related
knowledge and information through the project life cycle, efficient
