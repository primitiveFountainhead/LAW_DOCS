relation to the net quantity of commodities contained in packages, due account
shall be taken of the following causes which may lead to variation in the
quantity, namely:-(a)variations caused by unavoidable deviation in weighing,
measuring or counting the contents of individual packages that may occur in
good packaging practice;(b)variations caused by the ordinary and customary
exposure to conditions, such as, climate, transport, storage or the like that
normally occur in good distribution practice after the commodity is introduced
in trade or commerce; and(c)variation due to the nature of packaging material
or container.(4)The Director shall determine, or cause to be determined, in
relation to any commodity, the declaration in respect of the net quantity of
which is permitted to be qualified by the words "when packed ", the reasonable
variations which may take place by reason of the environmental conditions.

of this rule, "deceptive package "means a package which is so designed as to
deliberately give to the consumer an exaggerated or misleading impression as
to the quantity of the commodity contained therein, except where bigger
dimensions of the package can be justified by the manufacturer or the packer,
as the case may be, on the ground that such dimensions are necessary for
giving protection to the commodity contained in such package or for meeting
the requirements of the machine used for filling such package.(2)If the seized
packages contain any commodity which is subject to speedy or natural decay,
the Director or the authorised person shall dispose of the commodity in
accordance with the rules made under the Act.

24)DETERMINATION OF THE NET QUANTITY OF COMMODITIES CONTAINED IN PACKAGES

## Part I  EQUIPMENTS

### 1\. Equipments required.-(1) The Director, or other person authorised by
or under the Act, to determine the net quantity of commodity contained in any
package, shall be provided by the concerned Government with adequate
equipments and facilities to carry out his work to the required degree of
accuracy in an expedient and efficient manner.

(2)The equipments, referred to in sub-paragraph (1), shall ordinarily consist
of working standard weights and balances, or any other weight or measure
declared by the Director to be suitable for determining the net quantity
contained in the concerned package. (3) The Director or authorised person
shall, before determining the net quantity contained in any package, ensure
that the working standards and other equipments are functioning properly.

### 2\. Working standards to be ordinarily used.-(1) Ordinarily, working
standards and other weights and measures, duly verified shall be used for
determining the net quantities contained in packages and the errors, if any,
in relation to the net quantity declared on the package:

Provided that, where it is necessary to use the weights or measures owned or
controlled by the manufacturer, packer or wholesale dealer as the case may be,
such weights and measures shall not be used unless they are verified before
use and no such weight or measure, shall be used unless the maximum
permissible error of such weight or measure is twenty per cent or less of the
maximum error permitted in relation to the net quantity of the commodity
contained in the package.(2)It shall be the duty of every manufacturer, packer
or wholesale dealer to render such assistance to the Director or other
authorised person as the Director or the authorised person may require in
order to carry out his duties expeditiously and efficiently.(3)Where any
weight, measure or other equipment, owned or controlled by the manufacturer,
packer or wholesale dealer is used by the Director or other authorised person
for the determination of the net quantity contained in any package, such
weight, measure or other equipment shall not be released by the Director or
other authorised person until his work is completed.

## Part II

INSTRUCTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE DETERMINATION OF QUANTITY AND ERROR AT
MANUFACTURER'S OR PACKER'S PREMISES

### 3\. Procedure for determination of quantity by weight at manufacturer's or
packer's premises.-

(1)[ If empty tare packages are available, one such package shall be taken and
tare package weight determined. If the tare package weight is equal to or less
than three-tenth of the maximum permissible error for the concerned commodity
of that quantity, it shall be assumed that the tare package weight so
determined is valid for all the other packages in the sample, and the sample
packages shall then be weighed for gross weight, and thereafter the net weight
of commodity contained in each package shall be obtained by subtracting the
tare package weight from the gross package weight. If the tare package weight
so determined is more than three-tenths of the maximum permissible error in
relation to the commodity for that quantity, weight of four more empty tare
packages shall be determined. If the difference between the maximum tare
package weight and the minimum tare package weight of the five samples is
equal to or less than four-tenths of the maximum permissible error allowed for
that commodity for that quantity, the tare weight of the package shall be
taken as equal to the average of the five tare package weights. The gross
weight of the package in the sample shall then be determined and the average
tare package weight shall be substracted from the gross package weight to
obtain the net contents of the commodity in each package in the sample.
However, when the difference in the five individual tare weights of the
packages exceeds the limit of four-tenths of the maximum permissible error
specified above, the procedure specified in sub-paragraph (4) or sub-paragraph
(5), as the case may be, shall be adopted for determining the net quantity of
individual packages.] [Substituted by G.S.R. 594(E), dated 17-8-1999 (w.e.f.
16-11-1999).](2)In the absence of empty tare packages, one package from the
sample shall be opened and the net weight of the commodity and the tare weight
of the package determined. If the tare weight of the package is equal to or
less than three-tenth of the maximum permissible error for that concerned
commodity of that quality, it shall be assumed that the tare weight of one
package so determined is valid for all the other packages in the sample and
the remaining packages shall then be weighed for gross weight, and thereafter
the net weight of commodity contained in each package shall be obtained by
subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight.(3)If the tare weight of the
package specified in [sub-paragraph (2)] [Substituted by G.S.R. 594(E), dated
17-8-1999 (w.e.f. 16-11-1999).] is more than three-tenths of the maximum
permissible error in relation to that commodity, four more packages in the
samples shall be opened and the net weight of the commodity in each package as
well as the tare weight of each package shall be determined. If the difference
between the maximum tare weight and the minimum tare weight of five samples is
equal to or less than four-tenths of the maximum permissible error for that
commodity of that quantity, the tare weight of the package shall be taken as
equal to the arithmetic mean of the five tare weights. The gross weight of the
packages in the sample shall then be determined to the requisite accuracy and
the average tare weight of the container shall be subtracted from the gross
weight to obtain the net contents of commodity in each package in the
sample.(4)Where it is found on examining the first package, as described in
sub-paragraph (2) that the tare weight of the container exceeds the limits
specified in sub-paragraph (2) and sub-paragraph (3) and the determination of
net contents cannot be carried out without opening the remaining packages, or
it is not possible to use the procedure described in sub-paragraph (5), the
size of the sample to be examined shall be restricted to that indicated in
column (2) in accordance with the batch indicated in column (1) of [Table]
[Substituted by G.S.R. 594(E), dated 17-8-1999 (w.e.f. 16-11-1999). ] of the
Ninth Schedule and the determination of net quantity shall be carried out by
opening all the packages in the sample.(5)Where it is likely that the process
of determination of the actual net quantity may be destructive and it is
possible to feed empty package into the packing process without affecting the
results, the following procedure shall be used,(a)the number of empty
packages, depending upon the size of the batch, in accordance with columns (1)
and (2) of [Table] [Substituted by G.S.R. 594(E), dated 17-8-1999 (w.e.f.
16-11-1999). ] of the Ninth Schedule shall be selected;(b)the empty package
shall be marked suitably to identify them from the other packages;(c)the
weight of each empty package, with its other parts which are to be fitted on
it after it is filled shall be determined and the weight suitably recorded on
the empty package and also on the Form specified in the Eleventh
Schedule;(d)the empty package shall then be filled by introducing them in a
random manner in the packing process, and such introduction shall be
adequately spread over the duration in accordance with which the size of the
batch is determined;(e)the marked packages shall be taken out after completion
of the filling and sealing operations and each such filled package shall be
weighed again to the requisite accuracy;(f)the net quantity shall be obtained
by deducting the tare weight determined in accordance with clause (c) from the
gross weight.(6)The Director or other authorised person shall enter results of
his examination of gross weight, net weight and tare weight in the Form
specified in the Eleventh Schedule, alongwith such other observation as he may
wish to make on the basis of his examination.

### 4\. Determination of liquid contents by volume.-(1) If the specific
gravity of the liquid commodity filled in packages remains sufficiently
constant for a batch and it is possible to determine accurately its specific
gravity, the method of determination of net contents by weight, described in
paragraph 3 may be used.

(2)If the method described in sub-paragraph (1) is not feasible the containers
shall be opened and the contents of each package poured out carefully into the
appropriate volume measure.(3)The reading of the actual net volume of the
commodity in every package shall be noted carefully and recorded in the Form
specified in the Eleventh Schedule.

### 5\. Verification of length of commodities.-(l) The sample shall be
selected in the manner specified in the Ninth Schedule.

(2)If it is not possible to measure the dimensions without opening the
package, the packages shall be opened.(3)The length of the commodity shall be
measured by means of a calibrated steel tape of suitable length.(4)If the
actual length of the commodity is so great that it is not possible to measure
it with the tape measure and a suitable length measuring instrument is
available on the premises, that instrument shall be used, after duly
calibrating it by suitable means, with the steel tape serving as a working
standard of length.(5)The reading of the actual length of the commodity in
every package shall be noted carefully and recorded in the Form specified in
the Eleventh Schedule.

### 6\. Verification of commodities packed by number.-The Director or
authorised person shall take packages from the sample drawn by him in the
manner specified in the Ninth Schedule and determine the extent of error, by
actual counting in each such package and may, for that purpose, open all
packages.

[***] [Paragraph 7 omitted by G.S.R. 425(E), dated 17-7-2006 (w.e.f.
13-1-2007).]

### 8\. Checking of other declarations.-(1) The declarations made on the
package or on the label affixed thereto, shall be examined with a view to
ascertaining whether such declarations confirm to these rules [and may be
ensured either at the factory level or at the depot of the factory] [Added by
G.S.R. 425(E), dated 17-7-2006 (w.e.f. 13-1-2007).].

(2)The additional declarations made on the package or on the label affixed
thereto in respect of items (g) and (h) of sub-rule (1) of rule 6 shall also
be examined to ascertain whether they are adequate.THE ELEVENTH SCHEDULEFORM
