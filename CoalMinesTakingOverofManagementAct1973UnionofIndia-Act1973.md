Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973Act No. 15 of 1973

### 1485.

Object and Reasons.- Coal is the most important indigenous source of
commercial energy in India. It is available in adequate quantities in India.
though much of it is poor in quality and the reserves are unevenly distributed
among different regions of the country. With the recent nationalisation of 214
coking coal mines in Bengal-Bihar region, the development of metallurgical
coal has been brought under the control of the Government except in case of
captive coal mines of the private steel plants. The non-coking coal mines,
however, still predominantly continue to remain in the hands of the private
sector, the public sector undertakings namely National Coal Development
Corporation, Bharat Coking Coal and Singareni Collieries Company contributing
only 1/3rd of the total national production. Most of the production of non-
coking coal in private sector comes from Bengal-Bihar region where the
collieries are concentrated. These collieries are small in size, financially
weak and are worked on unscientific lines, the colliery owner's sole object
being to earn quick profits without any regard to the conservation and safety
of mines or to meet their obligations to the workers. This has resulted in the
stagnation of production in many collieries and closure of many others.It is
envisaged that in order to meet, by 1978-79, an ticipated demand of coal,
large scale efforts would be necessary to raise the production to which the
private sector alone is expected to contribute an additional quantity of 19
million tonnes. requiring an investment of Rs. 100 crores during the next 6
years. It is felt that in the existing circumstances the private sector will
not be able to fulfil these obligations. It is. therefore, proposed to
nationalise the non-coking coal mines as early as possible. Since such
nationalisation will take some time, the management of the non-coking coal
mines pending nationalisation thereof, was taken over by the Central
Government under the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Ordinance, 1973.
The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance.[31st March, 1973]An Act to
provide for the taking over, in the public interest, of the management of coal
mines, pending nationalisation of such mines, with a view to ensuring rational
and co-ordinated development of coal production and for promoting optimum
utilisation of the coal resources consistent with the growing requirements of
the country, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.Be it
enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as
follows:-
