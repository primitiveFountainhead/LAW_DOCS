Objective, Norms and Methodology

### 4. Objective.

\- The objectives of these regulations are to ensure compliance of the
Standards of Performance by the inter-State transmission licensees and to
provide for an efficient, reliable, coordinated and economical system of
electricity transmission, non-adherence of which would entitle the affected
parties to compensation.

### 5. Standards of Performance.

(1)All inter-State transmission licensees shall comply with the Standards of
Performance specified in these regulations:-(a)Transmission System
Availability(i)The transmission system availability shall be calculated
element-wise on monthly basis, in the same manner as provided for in the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions of Tariff)
Regulations, 2009, as amended from time to time and any subsequent enactment
thereof.(ii)The deemed availability of the transmission elements under outage
shall be as specified in the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms
and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2009, as amended from time to time and
any subsequent enactment thereof.(iii)The element-wise monthly availability of
the transmission system shall not be below the availability as given below:-

SI. No. | Transmission Elements | Availability (% of time)  
---|---|---  
(i) | AC Transmission line | 90  
(ii) | ICTs | 90

Notes : (1) Tower collapse shall not be counted for the purpose of calculation
of monthly availability of AC transmission line and HVDC bipole
line.(2)Failure of Inter-Connecting Transformer (ICT) and Reactor shall not be
counted for the purpose of calculation of availability of Inter-Connectivity
Transformer and Reactor.(iv)The element-wise monthly availability shall be
certified by the Member-Secretary of the Regional Power
Committee.(b)Restoration timeRestoration time for different types of failures
of transmission line and Inter-Connecting Transformer (ICT) and reactors shall
not exceed the following time limit:-

SI. No. | Types of failures | Restoration Time (Days)  
---|---|---

### 6.

Any failure by the inter-State transmission licensee to maintain the standards
of performance specified in these regulations shall render the said licensee
liable to payment of compensation to an affected person claiming such
compensation under the provisions of the Act:Provided also that the payment of
compensation by the Inter-State transmission licensee shall be without
prejudice to any penalty, which may be imposed or any prosecution which may be
initiated by the Commission as provided in the Act.

### 7. Methodology for compensation.

\- An affected person who has suffered a loss on account of non-adherence to
the Standard of Performance by any inter-State transmission licensee may make
an appropriate application to the Commission for award of
compensation:Provided that the Commission shall determine the compensation
after giving reasonable opportunity to the transmission licensees of being
heard:Provided Further that the compensation to be paid by the inter-State
transmission licensee to the affected party shall be limited to the
transmission charges of the particular element to the extent to which it has
affected the supply of electricity to the affected person:Provided Further
that the inter-State transmission licensee shall not be entitled to recover
the amount of compensation awarded through tariff from the users of the
transmission electricity:Provided also that no claim for compensation shall be
entertained if the application for the claim is filed after expiry of a period
of ninety days from the end of the month when the availability of the
transmission system falls short of the availability specified in clause 5(a)
and ninety days from the date of restoration of transmission element, as the
case may be, for the standards prescribed in clause (b) of Regulation 5 of
these regulations.

## Chapter 3  
Information to be Furnished by the Inter-State Transmission Licensees

### 8. Information to be furnished by the inter-State Transmission Licensees.

the Act, shall furnish to the Commission, (a) the level of performance
achieved; and (b) the number of cases in which compensation was paid; and (c)
the aggregate amount of the compensation, in the formats in the Schedule of

Standard of Performance during Force Majeure conditions such as war, mutiny,
civil commotion, riot, flood, cyclone, storm, lightning, earthquake, grid
failure, and strike/curfew, lockout, fire affecting the inter-State
Transmission Licensee's installations and operation activities, or under such
other specific circumstances:Provided that the inter-State Transmission
Licensee shall not be discharged from its liability on account of its failure
to maintain the Standards of Performance under these regulations if such
failure can be attributed to the negligence or deficiency or lack of
preventive maintenance of the interstate transmission system or failure to
take reasonable precaution which has resulted in loss to the affected person.

### 10. Power to remove difficulties.

\- If any difficulty arises in giving effect to any of the provisions of these
