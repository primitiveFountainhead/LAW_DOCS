\- For effective conservation of rain-water, application for permission to
construct or reconstruct or alter or add to a Multi-storeyed building, shall
contain water conservation proposals as detailed below: -(A)Tiled and sloped
terrace building. - (1) In the tiled or sloped building, semicircular gutters
of width 15 to 25 centimetres of plastic or any other material shall be
provided on the down side roof slopes of the building for harvesting rain-
water. The gutter shall be connected at the downstream end with a down-pipe of
75 to 100 millimetres diameter, depending upon roof area and size of tank to
convey the harvested rain-water from gutters to a plastic or any other
material storage tank or sump (through a filter unit). An inlet screen (wire
mesh) to prevent entry of dry leaves and other debris into the downpipe shall
be fitted. The collected rain-water from the roof shall be allowed to pass
through a filter unit. The filter unit is to be filled with suitable filter
material such as well-burnt broken bricks (or pebbles) up to 15 centimetres
from top. The top 15 centimetres shall be filled up with coarse sand. The
filter unit shall be placed either over a storage tank or at bottom of the
down-pipe.(2)The filtered rain-water shall be collected in a collection tank
or storage tank placed over the ground or underground. The shape of the tank
shall be cylindrical, rectangular or square of suitable size with a capacity
ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 litres or even higher depending on the roof area.
The materials of construction shall be brick work, stone work, cement bricks,
ferro-cement, High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), plain cement concrete or
reinforced cement concrete. The storage tanks or collection tanks shall be
provided with pipe fixtures at appropriate places to draw the water, to clean
the tank and to dispose of the excess water depending upon use or reuse either
to open well or bore well to a percolation pit.(B)Ordinary building (Ground +
First Floor). - (1) Percolation pits of 30 to 45 centimetres diameter and of
depth adequate, not less than one metre, to recharge the ground, shall be
made. This pit shall be filled with suitable filter material such as well-
burnt broken bricks (or pebbles) up to 15 centimetres from top. The top 15
centimetres shall be filled up with coarse sand. The top of this pit shall be
covered with perforated reinforced concrete cement (RCC) slab or of any other
material, wherever considered necessary. The number of such percolation pits
shall be provided on the basis of one pit per 30 square metres of available
open terrace area or plinth area. The cross distance between the pits shall be
minimum 3 metres.(2)Wherever an open well or bore well is available within the
building premises the rain-water collected from the open terrace shall be
collected through pipes of 150 millimetres diameter or other suitable sizes
and led to filter pit of size 60 centimetres x 60 centimetres x 60 centimetres
x 60 centimetre (with appropriate filter material) and then led into the open
well or bore well through 150 millimetres diameter or other suitable pipes,
after filling up a storage tank or sump.(3)Wherever existing water storage
sumps are available, the rain-water so collected, after it passes through the
filter, shall be allowed to flow to the sump through closed pipes. An overflow
pipe shall be provided to the storage sump so that the surplus water is led
into the nearby open well or bore well or percolation pit.(4)In addition to
the percolation pits of 30 centimetres diameter to be provided at 3 metre
intervals, a pit of 1 to 1.5 metres width and appropriate depth, so as to
recharge the ground, shall be provided all along the plinth boundary depending
upon the soil classification below ground. This pit shall be filled with
appropriate filter material namely, broken bricks, pebbles, broken stones,
etc., at the bottom and the top 15 to 25 centimetres shall be filled with
coarse sand. The ground or pavement surface around the building shall be
sloped towards the percolation pit so that the surplus rain-water from terrace
and sides, open spaces, etc., flow over this sloped surfaces and spread into
the filter bed all around. Masonry dwarf walls 5 to 7.5 centimetres or of
suitable height depending upon the site conditions shall be constructed, if
necessary, at the entrance and exit gates to allow the surplus rain-water
collected within the compound to recharge the ground within the premises
itself, and from draining out to the road.(5)If the sub-soil is not a
permeable one (namely, clay or black cotton) appropriate recharge structures,
namely, recharge shaft or bore pit shall be provided below the filtration pits
so as to recharge the ground.(C)Group development, industries and
institutional building: - (1) For buildings for Ground + One Floor or Ground +
2 floors and above located within group development, industrial or
institutional premises, the specification detailed in items A, B and C above
shall apply.(2)The surplus surface run-off rain-water, in the open spaces
within the Group development or industrial or institutional premises shall be
allowed to run towards collection drains of suitable size and these drains
shall be construed as rain-water friendly storm-water drains. All the approach
and access roads to the buildings within the group development or industrial
or institutional premises shall also be provided within the rain-water-
friendly storm-water drains. These rain-water-friendly storm-water drains
shall not have pave bottom. If adequate spaces, are available in low lying
areas, percolation ponds of suitable size shall be formed and these rain-
water-friendly storm-water drains shall be led into the percolation ponds for
recharging the ground.(3)For other localised areas, recharge pits of .size of
minimum 1 metre x 1 metre x 1 metre or 1 metre diameter shall be provided
wherever needed, so as to prevent rain-water stagnation around the building.
For other places catch water pit structures of size 30 centimetres diameter
and 30 centimetres depth or higher depth as necessary shall be provided
wherever necessary. For existing paved storm-water drains, catch water pits of
30 centimetres diameter and 30 centimetres depth or higher depth, as
necessary, shall be provided at the bottom of these drains at 10 to 15 metre
intervals. These catch water pits shall be filled with appropriate filter
material as described in item 'B' above for ordinary building (Ground + First
floor).Explanation. - For the purposes of these rules, in regard to rain-water
harvesting structures are concerned any other modifications, additional
structures or alternative designs, furnished by the applicant shall be
considered for approval, if it conforms to rain-water harvesting concept to
the satisfaction of the competent authority for building plan approval.

different floors for different uses are specified in the following table in
terms of uniformly distributed static loads.

(ii)In designing the walls, columns, piers, their supports and foundations,
the following reductions is assumed total live loads on floors may be made: -

3 | 20  
4 | 30  
5 or more | 40  
  
(iii)No reduction shall be made in the case of warehouses, garages and other
buildings used for storage purposes and for factories and workshops designed
for 500 kg/M2.Live Loads On Floors

The lower value of 250 kg/ml should be taken where separate storage facilities
are provided and the higher value of 400 kg/m2 should be taken where such
provisions are lacking.

Type of Floors | Minimum Live Loads per kg/m2 of floor area | Alternative Minimum Live Load  
---|---|---  
(1) | (2) | (3)  
Floors of warehouses, workshops, factories andother buildings or parts of buildings of similar category formedium-weight loads. | 750 |

Explanation 1. - A reference to a "floor" includes a reference to any part of
that floor, and a reference to "slabs" includes boarding and beams or ribs
spaced not further apart than one metre between centres, and a reference to
"beams" means all other beams and ribs.Explanation 2. - Under loading class
No. 250, the reference to light workrooms envisages rooms in which some light
machines (for example, sewing machine used by millers or tailors) are operated
without a central driven unit, that is, the machines are independently
operated either by hand or by small motors. Under loading class No. 400, the
reference to work rooms generally envisages the installation of machines
operated with a central power-driven unit, with the individual machines being
belt driven.Explanation 3. - "Fixed seating" implies that the removal of the
seating and the use of the space for other purposes improbable. The maximum
likely load in this case is, therefore, closely controlled.Explanation 4. -
The loading in workshops, warehouses and factories varies considerably and so
three loadings under the terms "light", "medium" and "heavy" are introduced in
order to allow for more economical designs but the terms have no special
meaning in themselves other than the live load for which the relevant floor is
designed. It is, however, important particularly in the case of heavy weight
loads, to assess the actual loads to ensure that they are not in excess of
1,000 kg./m2; in cases where they are in excess, the design shall be based on
the actual loading.Explanation 5. - The load classification for stairs,
corridors, balconies and landings provide for the fact that these often serve
several occupancies and are us£d for transporting the furniture and
goods.(b)Live loads on roofs. - Allowance for live load on flat roofs, sloping
roofs and curved roofs shall be as given in the following Table: -TableLive
Loads on Floors

Type of roofs | Live Loads measured on plain | Minimum live load measured on plan  
---|---|---  
(1) | (2) | (3)  
Flat, sloping orcurved roof with slopes up to and including 10 degrees.(a) Access provided | 150kg./m2 |  375 kg. uniformly distributed over any span ofone metre width of the roof slab and 900 kg. uniformlydistributed over the span in the case of all beams.  
(b) Access not provided except for maintenance. | 75kg/m2 |  190 kg. uniformly distributed over any span ofone metre width of the roof slab and 450 Kg. uniformlydistributed over the span in the case of beam.  
Sloping roof with slope greater than 10 degrees |  (a) For roof membrane sheets of purline 75 kg./m2; less 2 kg./ m2for every degree increase in slope over 10degrees. |   
|  (b) For members supporting the roof membrane androof purlines, such as trusses, beams girders, etc.- 2/3 of loadin (a). | Subject to a minimum of 40 kg/m2  
|  (c) Loads in, (a) and (b) do not include loadsdue to snow, rain, dust collection, etc., and the effects of suchloads shall be appropriately considered. |   
Curved roofs with slope at springing greaterthan 10 degrees. |  (75-345 r2 kg./m2 Where r = h/ 1 h = the heightof the highest point of the structure measured from its springingand 1 = chord width of the roof in singly curved and shorter ofthe two sides, if doubly curved. | Subject to a minimum of 40 kg./m2  
  
Note. - For special types of roofs with highly permeable and absorbent
material, the contingency of roof material increasing in weight due to
absorption of moisture shall be provide for.(c)Impact and vibrations. - For
structure carrying live loads which reduce impact or of vibrations, the live
load shall be increased as follows:1(i)For flame supporting lifts and hoists -
100 per cent.(ii)For foundations, footings and piers supporting lifts and
hoisting apparatus - 40 per cent.(iii)For' light machinery, shaft or motor
units - 20 per cent minimum.(iv)For reciprocating machinery or power units -
50 per cent minimum.

### 3\. Wind load. - The wind load on a building shall be calculated on basis
of the basic wind pressure, given in the following Table, which is the
equivalent static pressure in the direction of blow of wind: -

(1)Basic wind pressures for the City. -

Height in Metres | Pressure in kg./m2  
---|---  
(1) | (2)  
up to 30 | 200  
35 | 208  
40 | 210  
45 | 217  
50 | 222  
60 | 230  
70 | 236  
80 | 244  
100 | 254  
120 | 264  
150 | 276  
  
For intermediate height, interpolated values may be adopted.(2)Wind pressures
on roofs. - For flat and perched roofs, the wind pressures and suctions normal
to the surface due to wind blowing at right angles to the ridge shall be
determined by multiplying the basic wind pressure (p) with the factors given
in the Table below:Wind Pressures on Roofs(Wind normal and ridges)

Slope of roof on | External | Wind pressure  
---|---|---  
(1) | (2) | (3)  
Windward side | Wind ward slope | Leeward slope  
0° | -1.00 P | \- 0.50 P  
10° | -0.70 P | \- 0.50 P  
20° | -0.40 P | \- 0.50 P  
30° | \- 0.10 P | \- 0.50 P  
40° | \+ 0.10P | \- 0.50 P  
50° | \+ 0.30 P | \- 0.50 P  
60° | \+ 0.30 P | \- 0.50 P  
70° | \+ 0.50 P | \- 0.50 P  
80° | \+ 0.50 P | \- 0.50 P  
90° | \+ 0.50 P | \- 0.50 P  
  
### 4\. Seismic loads. - The seismic coefficients, stress increase, design
live loads as stipulated in the National Building Code of India, 1,970, shall
be taken into account while designing the structures.
