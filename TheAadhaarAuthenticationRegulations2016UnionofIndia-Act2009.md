Aadhaar Authentication Framework

### 3. Types of Authentication.

\- There shall be two types of authentication facilities provided by the
Authority, namely-(i)Yes/No authentication facility, which may be carried out
using any of the modes specified in regulation 4(2); and(ii)e-KYC
authentication facility, which may be carried out only using OTP and/ or
biometric authentication modes as specified in regulation 4(2).

### 4. Modes of Authentication.

(1)An authentication request shall be entertained by the Authority only upon a
request sent by a requesting entity electronically in accordance with these
regulations and conforming to the specifications laid down by the
Authority.(2)Authentication may be carried out through the following
modes:(a)Demographic authentication: The Aadhaar number and demographic
information of the Aadhaar number holder obtained from the Aadhaar number
holder is matched with the demographic information of the Aadhaar number
holder in the CIDR.(b)One-time pin based authentication: A One Time Pin (OTP),
with limited time validity, is sent to the mobile number and/ or e-mail
address of the Aadhaar number holder registered with the Authority, or
generated by other appropriate means. The Aadhaar number holder shall provide
this OTP along with his Aadhaar number during authentication and the same
shall be matched with the OTP generated by the Authority.(c)Biometric-based
authentication: The Aadhaar number and biometric information submitted by an
Aadhaar number holder are matched with the biometric information of the said
Aadhaar number holder stored in the CIDR. This may be fingerprints-based or
iris-based authentication or other biometric modalities based on biometric
information stored in the CIDR.(d)Multi-factor authentication: A combination
of two or more of the above modes may be used for authentication.(3)A
requesting entity may choose suitable mode(s) of authentication from the modes
specified in sub-regulation (2) for a particular service or business function
as per its requirement, including multiple factor authentication for enhancing
security. For the avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that e-KYC
authentication shall only be carried out using OTP and/ or biometric
authentication.

### 5. Information to the Aadhaar number holder.

(1)At the time of authentication, a requesting entity shall inform the Aadhaar
number holder of the following details:-(a)the nature of information that will
be shared by the Authority upon authentication;(b)the uses to which the
information received during authentication may be put; and(c)alternatives to
submission of identity information.(2)A requesting entity shall ensure that
the information referred to in sub-regulation (1) above is provided to the
Aadhaar number holder in local language as well.

### 6. Consent of the Aadhaar number holder.

(1)After communicating the information in accordance with regulation 5, a
requesting entity shall obtain the consent of the Aadhaar number holder for
the authentication.(2)A requesting entity shall obtain the consent referred to
in sub-regulation (1) above in physical or preferably in electronic form and
maintain logs or records of the consent obtained in the manner and form as may
be specified by the Authority for this purpose.

### 7. Capturing of biometric information by requesting entity.

(1)A requesting entity shall capture the biometric information of the Aadhaar
number holder using certified biometric devices as per the processes and
specifications laid down by the Authority.(2)A requesting entity shall
necessarily encrypt and secure the biometric data at the time of capture as
per the specifications laid down by the Authority.(3)For optimum results in
capturing of biometric information, a requesting entity shall adopt the
processes as may be specified by the Authority from time to time for this
purpose.

### 8. Devices, client applications, etc. used in authentication.

(1)All devices and equipment used for authentication shall be certified as
required and as per the specifications issued, by the Authority from time to
time for this purpose.(2)The client applications i.e. software used by
requesting entity for the purpose of authentication, shall conform to the
standard APIs and specifications laid down by the Authority from time to time
for this purpose.

### 9. Process of sending authentication requests.

(1)After collecting the Aadhaar number or any other identifier provided by the
requesting entity which is mapped to Aadhaar number and necessary demographic
and / or biometric information and/ or OTP from the Aadhaar number holder, the
client application shall immediately package and encrypt these input
parameters into PID block before any transmission, as per the specifications
laid down by the Authority, and shall send it to server of the requesting
entity using secure protocols as may be laid down by the Authority for this
purpose.(2)After validation, the server of a requesting entity shall pass the
authentication request to the CIDR, through the server of the Authentication
Service Agency as per the specifications laid down by the Authority. The
authentication request shall be digitally signed by the requesting entity
and/or by the Authentication Service Agency, as per the mutual agreement
between them.(3)Based on the mode of authentication request, the CIDR shall
validate the input parameters against the data stored therein and return a
digitally signed Yes or No authentication response, or a digitally signed
e-KYC authentication response with encrypted e-KYC data, as the case may be,
along with other technical details related to the authentication
transaction.(4)In all modes of authentication, the Aadhaar number is mandatory
and is submitted along with the input parameters specified in sub-regulation
(1) above such that authentication is always reduced to a 1:1 match.(5)A
requesting entity shall ensure that encryption of PID Block takes place at the
time of capture on the authentication device as per the processes and
specifications laid down by the Authority.

### 10. Notification of authentication to Aadhaar number holder.

\- The Aadhaar number holder may be notified of any biometric and/or OTP based
authentication, through the registered email and/or mobile number of the
Aadhaar number holder as determined by the Authority, at the time of
authentication.

### 11. Biometric locking.

(1)The Authority may enable an Aadhaar number holder to permanently lock his
biometrics and temporarily unlock it when needed for biometric
authentication.(2)All biometric authentication against any such locked
biometric records shall fail with a "No" answer with an appropriate response
code.(3)An Aadhaar number holder shall be allowed to temporarily unlock his
biometrics for authentication, and such temporary unlocking shall not continue
beyond the time period specified by the Authority or till completion of the
authentication transaction, whichever is earlier.(4)The Authority may make
provisions for Aadhaar number holders to remove such permanent locks at any
point in a secure manner.
