The Companies Act, 1956(1 OF 1956)

### 1. Statement of Objects and Reasons.-

The object of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the law relating to
Companies. The last major amendment of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of
1913) was undertaken in 1936 when the Indian Companies (Amendment) Act, 1936
(22 of 1936) was passed. At the end of World War II the need was felt for a
further extensive revision of the Companies Act. Apart from the experience
gained on the actual working of the Amendment Act of 1936, which disclosed the
necessity for an early amendment of some of its provisions, many changes had
taken place in the intervening years in the organisation and management of
Joint Stock Companies, and over a wide sector that was dominated by new
elements in trade and industry, the character of company management had also
materially altered. Further, at the end of the War, the Company Law Amendment
Committee in the United Kingdom, more familiarly known as the Cohen Committee,
had submitted its report after a laborious enquiry spread over two years. This
report recommended several far reaching changes in the English Companies Act,
1929. As the Indian Company Law had been always largely based on the
prevailing English Law, the then Government felt that the time was ripe for a
further review of the Indian Companies Act. A good deal of exploratory work
was done between 1946 and 1950. Two distinguished company lawyers were
successively appointed to advise Government on the broad lines on which the
Indian Companies Act should be revised. The recommendations of these two
lawyers were further examined in the then Ministry of Commerce, and certain
tentative departmental views which emerged were circulated in a memorandum to
the general public for eliciting opinion on them. Many representations on this
memorandum were duly received from trade and industrial organisations, learned
bodies, associations, State Governments and the general public. At the end of
1950, the Government of India appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of
Shri C.H. Bhabha to go into the entire question of the revision of the Indian
Companies Act, with particular reference to its bearing on the development of
Indian trade and industry. This Committee examined a large number of witnesses
in different parts of the country and submitted its report in March, 1952. The
report was circulated to all State Governments, Chambers of Commerce, many
trade associations and several learned bodies for an expression of their views
on the recommendations contained in it. A special officer was also appointed
in the Department of Economic Affairs at the same time to examine the report
and, on the basis of the views expressed by these organised trade and other
associations and the general public to submit proposals to Government for the
revision of the Indian Companies Act.2\. The present Bill is based largely on
the recommendations of the Company Law Committee modified in a few particulars
by the views expressed on these recommendations. The main principles
underlying these recommendations are as follows:-(i) the provisions of the law
both in regard to the formation and management of joint stock companies should
be such as would ensure the maintenance of a minimum standard of good
behaviour in company promotion and management without imposing needlessly
irksome or rigid rules which may hamper legitimate business or affect
initiative or enterprise;(ii) the law should provide for the fullest possible
disclosure in prospectuses or statements in lieu of prospectuses issued, both
before and after a company is formed, and failure to make such disclosure
should be visited with effective penalties;(iii) company accounts should be
prepared in such a way as to disclose all facts which are material to a full
understanding of the manner in which companies are worked;(iv) company
meetings should be called and conducted in such way as to ensure that
shareholders receive all reasonable facilities for exercising an intelligent
judgment on the activities of the management;(v) the provisions for
investigation into the affairs of a company should be so designed as to enable
an appropriate authority to intervene in its affairs not merely when an
offence has been committed, but also when it is established that the affairs
of a company are being managed in a manner prejudicial to the shareholders of
the company or oppressive to any substantial portion of them or when such
investigation is otherwise necessary in the public interest;(vi) the law
should also provide for the establishment of an appropriate authority not
merely for enforcing the provisions of the Companies Act or for carrying out
the investigations which may be necessary under it, but also for generally
overseeing the administration of the Act and for exercising in the public
interest that reserve authority which must necessarily vest in some organ of
Government.The provisions of the Bill in its different parts follow largely
from the above principles.The major changes in the present Indian Companies
Act which the Bill introduces thus relate to the following topics:-(a) the
promotion and formation of companies (clauses 50 to 74);(b) the capital
structure of companies (clauses 79 to 83);(c) company meetings and procedure
(clauses 158 to 189);(d) the presentation of company accounts, their audit,
and the powers and duties of auditors (clauses 195 to 218);(e) the inspection
and investigation of the affairs of companies (clauses 219 to 235);(f) the
constitution of Boards of Directors, and the powers and duties of Directors;
Managing Directors and Managers (clauses 236 to 306);(g) the appointment of
managing agents, terms and conditions of their service, their remuneration,
the powers of managing agents vis-a-vis Directors, and the activities of
managing agents in regard to borrowings, loans, contracts, sales and purchases
(clauses 307 to 359);(h) the administration of company law.Most of the new
provisions contained in the Bill on all these points are self-explanatory, and
in the case of almost all these provisions the relevant notes on clauses have
indicated the recommendations of the Company Law Committee on which they are
based.3\. As has been already mentioned, in a few particulars, the provisions
of the Bill have deviated from the recommendations of the Company Law
Committee. These deviations are, however, of a minor nature, and the notes on
clauses have duly indicated and explained them. There is, however, one
important deviation from the recommendations of the Company Law Committee
which needs special mention. The Company Law Committee devoted a good deal of
space in its report to problems of organisation and administration, and
recommended that the Central Government should not only resume its
responsibility for the administration of joint stock companies which, it had
delegated to the State Governments, but that a statutory authority at the
Centre, to be called "Corporate investment and Administration Commission",
should be set up under the new Act for the administration of the company law
as well as for the discharge of other related functions, e.g., capital issue
control and regulation of stock exchanges when a Central measure for this
latter purpose was passed. Action has already been taken on the first
recommendation of the Company Law Committee. The State Governments have been
addressed regarding the intention of the Central Government to resume its
powers under the Indian Companies Act and the constitution of a Central
Organisation under the administrative control of the Department of Economic
Affairs, has been sanctioned. It is, however, proposed that the question of
conferring statutory status on this Organisation if so necessary be considered
after this Central Organisation has been set up and functioned for a
reasonable period. For the present therefore, the duties and responsibilities
which the Company Law Committee visualised for the statutory authority would
be 'carried on by the new departmental organisation.In the light of the recent
experience of the Central Government, provision has also been made in the Bill
in respect of one or two matters which were not covered by the recommendations
of the Company Law Committee but which are considered to be of sufficient
importance to the working of joint stock companies in future to justify the
making of special provisions in regard to them (e.g., clause 366). The notes
on the relevant clauses will explain the reasons for these provisions.4\. It
is necessary to draw attention in this context to two other recommendations of
the Company Law Committee which have affected the structure of the Bill. In
the Indian Companies (Amendment) Act, 1951 (52 of 1951), certain special
powers were conferred on Courts of law and the Central Government. While the
powers conferred on the Courts by section 7 of that Act were based largely on
the provisions of section 210 of the English Companies Act, 1948, the other
powers conferred on the Central Government were of a quasi-administrative
nature to be exercised on the recommendations of an Advisory Commission
provided for under section 8 of the Amendment Act. The Company Law Committee
recommended that if and when the Indian Companies Act was comprehensively
revised on the lines of its recommendations, Government should consider the
desirability of repealing sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the Amendment Act of
1951 containing these quasi-administrative powers. While it is not proposed to
retain indefinitely these special powers, which the Central Government assumed
in 1951, it is considered that it will not be expedient for the Central
Government in the present circumstances of company management in this country,
to divest itself of these powers till experience of the working of the new Act
has shown that these special powers are no longer necessary. Clause 598 of the
Bill, therefore, proposes the retention of these powers for a period of three
years from the commencement of the new Act. The provision of sections 2, 3, 4,
6 and 8 of the Amendment Act of 1951, which have been incorporated in the
present Indian Companies Act as sections 86-J, 87-AA, 87-B [second proviso to
clause (c)], 87-BB, 87-CC and 289-B have, therefore, been relegated to a
Schedule (Schedule XI) attached to this Bill. Section 7 of the Amendment Act,
which it is proposed to incorporate permanently in the Companies Act has been
retained as clauses 367 to 377. The notes on these clauses explain these
structural changes.In regard to Table A in the present Act, the Company Law
Committee recommended that having regard to the importance of the provisions
contained in the compulsory regulations of this Table, it was desirable that
they should be inserted as independent sections in the Act itself. The
acceptance of this recommendation has involved the transfer to the body of the
Bill of many of the provisions hitherto included in Table A. Further, in order
to avoid unnecessary duplication those regulations in Table A which merely
draw attention to the relevant provisions of the Act have been omitted. In the
result the new Table A has been considerably abridged. The notes on clauses
relating to this Table explain these structural alterations.5\. Advantage has
been taken of the opportunity offered for the consolidation of the Act for the
first time since 1913 to rearrange its different parts in a more logical
order. The general principle has been to arrange the different parts of the
Act in such a way that they follow, as far as possible, the chronological
sequence in the formation, growth and decay of companies. Thus, for example,
it has been felt that the provisions of the Act which relate to the formation
of companies should precede those relating to their management. The re-
arrangement of matter which has followed as a consequence of this decision has
entailed considerable changes in the structure of the present Act. It is,
however, felt that these changes will eventually result in a better
understanding and appreciation of the scheme of the Indian Companies Act.There
is one matter which the Committee would emphasize. The Bill confers very wide
powers on the Central Government, the exercise of which will involve the
taking of decisions at the highest level in the Ministry concerned. The Joint
Committee consider that it is of the utmost importance that Governments should
create a full-fledged Department under the appropriate Ministry, functioning
directly under the Minister concerned, for the administration of the Companies
Act and the discharge of the other related functions:'- J.C.R. - Gazette of
India, 1955, Pt. II, Section 2, Extra., page 241/29.Act 65 of 1960.- "The
object of this Bill is to amend the Companies Act, 1956. The Act had been in
force for about a year when Government decided that the defects and
deficiencies in its working should be examined by a Committee. Accordingly, in
May, 1957, the Government appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri
A.V. Visvanatha Sastri, a former Judge of the Madras High Court, to examine
the structure of the Act as well as its contents with a view not only to
removing its defects and deficiencies but also ensuring better fulfilment of
the purposes underlying the Act. In November, 1957, the Committee submitted
its report, which the Government published and placed before both Houses of
Parliament in December, 1957.2\. The present Bill is based largely on the
recommendations of the Committee, although in some particulars they have been
modified partly in the light of the experience of the working of the Act
gained since the submission of the Report and partly by the views expressed on
these recommendations by Chambers of Commerce and others. The amendments of
the Companies Act, as included in the Bill, fall under the following heads,(i)
amendments considered necessary to overcome practical difficulties experienced
in course of the working of the Act;(ii) amendments of a clarificatory nature,
designed to remove drafting defects and obscurities which have caused
difficulty in the interpretation of the Statute; and(iii) amendments
considered necessary to ensure the better fulfilment of the purposes of the
Act and to remove lacuna in the existing provisions." - Gaz. of Ind.,
1-5-1959, Pt. II, Section 2, Extra., page 502.Act 43 of 1962.- Section
293(1)(e) of the Companies Act, 1956, provides that the Board of Directors of
a public company or of a private company, which is a subsidiary of a public
company, may contribute to charitable and other funds not directly relating to
the business of the company or the welfare of its employees, any amount not
exceeding in aggregate, in any financial year, rupees twenty-five thousand or
five per cent, of its average net profits during the three financial years
immediately preceding, whichever is greater. If the Board wishes to exceed
this limit, it must obtain the consent of the company in general meeting. The
general meeting of a company can be called by giving not less than 21 days'
clear notice. Thus, the convening and holding of a general meeting of a public
company necessarily entails time and expense.2\. Although the above-mentioned
restrictions regarding contributions to charitable or other funds are not
applicable to the private companies which are not subsidiary of public
companies, it may not be possible for many such companies to make such
contributions in view of the provisions of their memorandum or articles of
association.3\. It was felt that companies may like to make generous
contributions to the National Defence Fund which has recently been created by
the Government to meet the emergency which has arisen as a result of China's
aggression against India, uninhibited by the limits and conditions imposed by
section 293(1)(e) of the Companies Act, 1956, or by their memorandum or
articles of association. Hence, an Ordinance, namely, the Companies
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1962, was promulgated by the President on the 3rd
November, 1962, authorizing the Board of Directors of companies themselves to
make contributions to the National Defence Fund or any other Fund approved by
the Central Government for the purpose of national defence, without any limit
and without obtaining the sanction of the company in general meeting.4\. The
present Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance with the addition of a
provision for the disclosure in the profit and loss account of a company of
the amounts of contributions made to the National Defence Fund or to any other
Fund approved for the purpose of National Defence by the Central Government. -
Gazette of India, 13-11-1962, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 820.Act 53 of 1963.-
In order to facilitate quick action against persons involved in cases of
fraud, misfeasance and other such malpractices and irregularities in the
management of companies, it is considered necessary to set up a Tribunal whose
findings would enable the Central Government to remove such persons from
positions of managerial authority in any company. This Tribunal will also be
empowered to hear certain applications under section 203 and sections 397 and
398 of the Companies Act, as these relate to matters of a similar nature. The
scope of sections 397 and 398 and other related sections is being enlarged to
provide for the entertainment of applications on grounds of public interest as
well besides those stated therein. This Tribunal will also be empowered to
exercise the powers and functions of the court under such sections of the
Companies Act as the Central Government may, from time to time, notify.In
order to prevent the use of voting rights attached to shares held by trusts
for the advancement of personal interests of the donors, it is considered
necessary to regulate the exercise of such rights in suitable cases. For this
purpose, it is proposed to empower the Central Government to appoint a person
to exercise voting rights in respect of trusts with significant share holding,
when necessary with a view to securing proper management of the company in the
interests of the shareholders.In cases where Government has advanced a loan to
a company, it is considered necessary that Government should have the power to
direct the conversion of such a loan into shares of that company on fair and
equitable terms. Where the loan agreement provides for such conversion, it is
proposed to dispense with the procedure prescribed under section 81 of the
Companies Act in regard to such conversion of loans given by Government and
specified financial institutions. Section 81 is proposed to be amended
accordingly.Further, it is considered desirable, for the better and convenient
administration of the Companies Act, to set up a Board to which will be
entrusted most of the powers and functions of the Central Government under the
Companies Act or other laws. The Board will function subject to the control of
the Central Government in all matters.The Bill seeks to amend the Companies
Act to give effect to the above proposals. - Gazette of India, 26-11-1963, Pt.
II, Section 2, Ext, P. 821.Act 32 of 1964.- Investigations of the affairs,
true ownership and other related matters, of companies cannot be effectively
conducted unless there is full disclosure by their employees of factual
information in regan to various matters to be scrutinised by the Inspector
appointed by the Central Government. In order to give to the employees of the
affected companies temporal) protection against victimisation in such cases it
has beet considered necessary to make a suitable provision in the Companies
Act that no company can discharge or take any other action against any of its
employees during the investigation of its affairs and true ownership, etc., by
Inspectors or during the pendency of proceedings against any of its managerial
personnel before the Tribunal, unless it has given previous intimation to the
Company Law Board of the proposed action against the employees and the Company
Law Board has not raised any objection to such action.As it was apprehended
that some of the companies whose affairs were under investigation might take
action against their employees if they disclosed full information to the
Inspectors, the amendment of the Companies Act on the lines indicated above
was considered be a matter of extreme urgency and the Companies (Amendment)
Ordinance, 1964 was therefore, promulgated by the President on the 5th July,
1964. The present Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance without
modification in the provisions thereof. - Gazette of India 7-9-1964, Pt. II,
Section 2, Ext., P. 439.Act 31 of 1965.- In pursuance of its terms of
reference, the Commission of Inquiry on the administration of Dalmia-Jain
Companies made certain recommendations for the amendment of the Companies Act
view to prevent in future malpractices of the nature observed by it, and also
to ensure due and proper administration of the funds and assets of companies
in the interest of the investing public. Later, at the instance of government,
a Committee consisting of Shri C.K. Daphtary and Shri A.V. Visvanatha Sastri
examined the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry and made suggestions
of its own for amending the said Act. The Bill, inter alia, seeks to implement
the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry and the Daphtary-Sastri
Committee.2\. Opportunity is also being taken (i) to strengthen the provisions
relating to investigation into the affairs of companies and to provide for
more effective audit in dealing with cases of dishonesty and fraud in the
corporate sector, and (ii) to simplify some of the procedural requirements
which are at present burdensome companies without being of corresponding
advantage the Government.3\. The notes on clauses explain the provisions of
Bill. - Gazette of India, 21-9-1964, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 622Act 34 of
1966.- The Vivian Bose Commission of Inquiry had recommended inter alia that
inter-company loans should rank at par with inter-company inves and should be
subject to thesame restrictions as the latter. This recommendation was sought
to be given effect to by amending section 370 of the Companies Act by section
46 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1965. It has, however, been noticed that
the restrictions placed by this amendment would equally apply in respect of
guarantees given and securities provided by certain classes of companies viz.:
financial institutions, insurance companies and private companies simpliciter,
and would, therefore, act as a serious hindrance to their normal functioning,
Since loans given by such companies have already been exempted from the scope
of the restriction, it has been decided to afford similar exemption to
guarantees given and securities provided by such companies.2\. Opportunity is
also being taken to make a consequential amendment to sub-section (1-A) of
section 240 on the lines of similar amendments made to clause (a) of sub-
section (1) and clause (a) of sub-section (3) of that section by the Companies
(Amendment) Act, 1965.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects -
Gazette of India, 22-11-1965, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 1127.Act 17 of
1969.- On the 1st December, 1967, an assurance was given to the Lok Sabha that
Government would bring forward during the next following buds session of
Parliament a Bill to ban contributions by companies to any political party, or
for any political purpose to any individual or body and to abolish the system
of management of companies by managing agents. The Bill seeks to fulfil the
assurance. It also seeks to abolish simultaneously the system of management of
companies by secretaries and treasurers which is akin to the system of
management of companies by managing agents.2\. The property of companies
making contributions to any political party, or for any political purpose to
any individual or body has for some time been the subject of discussion both
inside and outside the Parliament. A view has been expressed that such
contributions have a tendency to corrupt political life and to adversely
affect healthy growth of democracy in the country and it has been gaining
ground with the passage of time. It is, therefore, proposed to ban such
contributions.';3\. Section 324 of the Companies Act, 1956 empowers the
Central Government to notify that companies engaged in specified classes of
industry or business shall not have managing agents. Under the Rules framed
thereunder, Government appointed the Managing Agency Enquiry Committee to
enquire into the desirability of applying the said provisions to companies
engaged in established industries or any other industry or business as may be
deemed fit by the Committee. In pursuance of the Report of the Committee
submitted on the 16th March, 1966, Government issued a notification to the
effect that the term of office of a managing agent of any company in the
specified industries shall expire at the end of three years from the 2nd
April, 1967.The Monopolies Inquiry Commission observed that the system of
managing agencies was one of the most important causes which hastened the
process of concentration of economic power in India.Taking all the factors
into consideration, it is proposed to abolish the system of management of
companies by managing agents altogether at the same time as in the case of
specified industries referred to above.4\. The Managing Agency Enquiry
Committee observed that, at one time, the institution of secretaries and
treasurers was thought of as a suitable alternative to the managing agency
system but for all practical purposes secretaries and treasurers exist only in
those cases where managing agents already in existence had to shed some of the
managed companies in view of the limit of ten on the total number of companies
that a managing agent can manage. The Committee did not see any particular
gain in such a change. Secretaries and treasurers can be given all the powers
and privileges of a managing agent except that they (i.e. the former) cannot
appoint their representative on the Board of Directors of the managed company,
and cannot draw more than 7-1/2 per cent, as their commission while the
managing agents can draw up to 10 per cent, of the net profit. It would thus
be obvious that no useful purpose would be served by abolishing the managing
agency system alone if the resultant void is to be filled up by the
secretaries and treasurers. Hence the Government proposes to abolish the
system of management of companies by secretaries and treasurers simultaneously
with the abolition of the system of management of companies by managing
agents. - Gaz. of Ind., 10-5-1968, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 699.Act 41 of
1974.- "The present Bill seeks to meet cases of such abuse or distortion of
the system which have, of late assumed comparatively serious proportions. It
further represents an instalment of the remedial measures under contemplation
as a result of the process of comprehensive review of the working of the Act
which has been undertaken by the Government, in the light of the report of the
Administrative Reforms Commission and its concerned working group and in the
light of various suggestions, received by the Governments from diverse
quarters from time to time for the amendment of the Act" - Gazette of India,
11-8-1972, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., p. 709. For salient features of the
Amending Act 41 of 1974 - See Department of Company Affairs, Ministry of Law,
Justice and Company Affairs, Government of India, Press Note dt. 15-1-1975.Act
46 of 1977.- "In the Companies Act, 1956, Section 58A relating to acceptance
of deposits was inserted by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1974, which came
into force on the 1st February, 1975. Prior to the coming into force of this
section, acceptance of deposits by companies was regulated by the directions
issued by the Reserve Bank of India under Chapter III-B the Reserve Bank of
India Act, 1934, Clause (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 58A provides that
every deposit accepted by a company at any time before the commencement of the
said Amendment Act of 1974, shall, if it is not renewed by a company in
accordance with the provisions of that section, be repaid in accordance with
the terms of such deposit. Clause (c) of that sub-section provides that any
deposit received by a company in contravention of the aforesaid directions of
the Reserve Bank shall be repaid in full on or before 1-4-1975. Sub-section
(5) of that section provides for penalty for contravention of the provisions
of the subsection. A review of the cases of contraventions shows that
sometimes they are due to circumstances beyond the control of the companies,
namely, strikes, riots, power-cuts, recession, etc. Sub-section (7) of Section
58-A empowers the Central Government to give total exemption to a company from
provisions of the section after consulting the Reserve Bank of India. There
is, however, no power to grant partial relaxation like extension of time in
deserving cases for the repayment of deposits. A study group constituted by
the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri James S. Raj
recommended that Section 58A of the Act may be suitably amended to grant
extension of time to.comply with or to exempt any company from the provisions
of that section. It is proposed to accept the recommendation and amend Section
58A suitably.In the State of Bombay v. Bandhan Ram Bhandari (AIR 1961 SC 186),
the question arose as to whether the company and its officers are liable to be
prosecuted under the 1913 Act for not laying the balance-sheet and the profit
and loss account before the Company in annual general meeting, where the
annual general meeting was not held. In that case, the Supreme Court took the
view that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default
as a defence to the charge. If he was responsible for not calling the annual
general meeting, he could not be heard to say in his defence to the charge
that as the general meeting was not held, the balance sheet and the profit and
loss account could not be laid before the company in annual general meeting. A
different view has, however, been taken on the point by the Supreme Court in
the case of State of Andhra Pradesh v. A.P. Provincial Potteries Ltd. (AIR
1973 SC 2429).Persons in charge of the management of some of the companies
sometimes omit to convene the annual general meeting of the company and by
such omission keep the shareholders as well as the creditors of the company in
the dark about the affairs of the company and its financial condition.
Further, by such omission, they also evade the necessity of filing the balance
sheet and profit and loss account with the Registrar of Companies. When a
document is filed with the Registrar of Companies, it is open to any
shareholder or creditor to inspect such document and to obtain a copy thereof.
In the circumstances, it is absolutely essential that even where the annual
general meeting of the company has not been held, the balance-sheet and profit
and loss account should be filed with the Registrar of Companies to enable the
share-holders and other persons to find out, from inspection of the said
documents, the affairs of the company and its financial condition. The Bill
seeks to amend Section 220 to achieve the said object.Under Section 293 of the
Companies Act, 1956, a company is empowered to make donations for charitable
purposes up to five per cent of its average net profits during the preceding
three years or up to Rs. 25,000 whichever is greater. The ceiling of Rs.
25,000 was fixed long ago and it is felt that in the present context, the said
ceiling should be raised to Rs. 50,000. The Bill seeks to amend Section 293.
Section 620 of the Companies Act, 1956, empowers the Central Government to
modify, by notification, any of the provisions of the said Act in its
application to a particular Government Company or to Government Companies in
general. Every notification proposing to make such modification is required to
be placed, in draft, before each House of Parliament for a period of not less
than 30 days while it is in session. Since the said period of 30 days cannot,
sometimes, be completed in one session, it is necessary to amend the section
to permit the period of 30 days to be completed in one session or in two or
more successive sessions. The Bill seeks to amend Section 620 to achieve the
said object.Other amendments included in the Bill are of a con sequential or
formal nature" - S.O.R. - Gazette of India, 24-11-1977, Pt. II, Section 2,
Ext., P. 738.Act 35 of 1985.- At present under section 293A of the Companies
Act, there is a blanket ban on political contributions by companies. In his
Budget speech, the Finance Minister has made an announcement that with a view
to permitting the corporate sector to play a legitimate role within the
defined norms in the functioning of our democracy, necessary legislation would
be, undertaken to allow companies to make contributions to political parties
from out of their profits. For this purpose, it is proposed to substitute
(vide clause 2 of the Bill) a new section for section 293A of the Companies
Act. The new section seeks to continue the existing blanket ban against
political contributions in the case of Governed companies and companies which
have been in existence for less than three financial years. The new section
seeks to permit any other company to make political contributions not
exceeding five per cent of its average net profits if a resolution authorising
such contributions is passed at a meeting of the Board of Directors. The new
section also seeks to impose an obligation on every company to disclose in its
profit and loss account any amounts amounts contributed by it to any political
party or for any political purpose. Under the new section, if a company makes
any political contribution in contravention of the provisions thereof, the
company would be liable to fine which may extend to three times the amount
contributed. Further, every officer of the company in default, would be liable
to imprisonment for a term may extend to three years and also to fine.2\.
Another announcement made by the Finance Minister in his Budget speech relates
to the decision of Government to introduce necessary legislation so legitimate
dues of workers rank pari passu with secured creditors in the event of closure
of the company and a even the dues to Government. The resources of companies
constitute a major segment of the material resources of the community and
common good demands that the ownership and control of the resources of every
company are so distributed that in the unfortunate event of its liquidation,
workers, whose labour and effort constitute an invisible but easily
perceivable part of the capital of the company are not deprived of their
legitimate right to participate in the product of their labour and effort. It
is accordingly proposed to amend sections 529 and 530 of the Companies Act and
also to incorporate a new section in the Act, namely section 529A (vide
clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill)3\. Section 396 of the Companies Act empowers
the Central Government to order amalgamation of companies in public interest.
The Committee on Subordinate Legislation (Seventh Lok Sabha) have recommended
that the Company Law Board should be empowered to reassess compensation on
appeal from the order of the prescribed authority assessing the compensation
payable under an order of amalgamation under this section. The Committee have
also recommended that the order of amalgamation itself may provide for the
continuation of any pending legal proceedings by and against the transferee
company on the lines of the existing provisions of section 394 of the Act
under which the High Court orders amalgamation. Section 396 of the Act is
proposed to be amended suitably to give effect to these recommendations (vide
clause 3 of the Bill.).4\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. -
Gazette of India, 9-5-1985, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 6 (No. 24).Act 31 of
1988.- Government has in the light of the recommendations made by the Expert
Committee (Sachar Committee) and in the light of the experience gained in the
administration of the Companies Act, 1956, over the last few years, felt it
necessary to bring certain amendments to that Act.2\. The salient features of
the amendments are :-(a) the setting up of an independent Company Law Board to
exercise such judicial and quasi-judicial functions as are presently being
exercised either by the Court or the Central Government and are proposed to be
transferred to that Board;(b) compounding of offences punishable with fine;(c)
dispensing with Government approval for managerial appointments and
remuneration subject to the fulfilment of certain statutory guidelines which
are proposed to be incorporated in the Act itself;(d) de-linking of the rates
of depreciation from the rates specified under the Income-tax Act and laying
down the rates of depreciation in the Act itself to reflect the true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company;(e) protecting the interests of
the investors by providing for intervention by the company Law Board against
non-repayment of public deposits; compulsory redemption of preference shares
in cer tain cases, requiring companies to disclose reasons for refusal to
register transfer of shares; and protecting the rights of the transferee
pending mutation of his name in the register of members; and also compulsory
listing of all public issues;(f) reducing unnecessary cost or burden by
requiring companies to attach only an abridged form of prospectus to the
application form and only an abridged version of balance sheet and auditors'
report to members and also by requiring companies to hold a poll in general
meeting only at the instance of the shareholders having some minimum stake in
the company; and further requiring companies to file full annual return only
once in six years;(g) provision for disclosure of information relating to
conservation of energy, technology absorption, foreign exchange earnings and
outgo as well as particulars of employees having some minimum stake in the
company and drawing remuneration in excess of that drawn by managerial
personnel.3\. The proposals also include provisions to plug loopholes and
remove some lacunae which have come to surface in the working of the Act. It
is also proposed to streamline some of the existing provisions for better
working and administration of the Act. Certain consequential and incidental
changes are also sought to be made. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
objectives.4\. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the provisions of the
Bill. - Gazette of India, 31-8-1987, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 39 (No.
45).Act 5 of 1997.- In 1977, Government appointed a Committee for the
amendment of the Companies Act. 1956 and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade
Practices Act, 1969, popularly known as the Sachar Committee. Some of the
recommendations of the Sachar Committee led to the Companies (Amendment) Acts
of 1985 and 1988. However, while considering the proposals which led to the
enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1988, a decision was taken by
Government for a comprehensive review of the existing law.2\. Accordingly, the
Companies Bill, 1993 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 14th May, 1993. The
Bill has not yet been taken up for consideration. In view of suggestions from
the different forums the Government feels that the Bill would require
comprehensive revision keeping in view the changes which have taken place in
the capital market, operation of corporate sector and liberalisation policies.
For this purpose and having due regard to the statement made on 22nd July,
1996 in Parliament, the Government has set up a working group to revise the
Act. Since, this process would take a considerable time to complete its work,
it is felt that some changes in the Companies Act are imminent, therefore, it
is proposed to amend the Act, inter alia, as follows, namely :(i) to provide
protection to the depositors;(ii) to provide protection to employees' interest
in case of winding up of a company;(iii) to simplify some procedural and legal
requirements in the interest of corporate sector.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve
the above objectives. - Gazette of India, 10-9-1996, Pt. II-Section 2, Ext.,
P. 5 (No. 23).Act 21 of 1999.- The Companies Act, 1956 has been in force for
more than four decades and the economy has undergone considerable changes
since its introduction. Further, the law relating to Corporate Sector has been
undergoing changes in other countries taking into account recent developments
in the field of corporate law and practices. Taking into consideration these
developments and on the basis of a report prepared by a Wording Group
constituted in 1996, the Companies Bill, 1977 was introduced in Rajya Sabha on
14th August, 1997 to replace Companies Act, 1956. The Companies Bill, 1997
stands referred to Department related-Standing Committee on Home Affairs and
the report of the Standing Committee is awaited.2\. In view of the urgency
felt by the Government in this regard and as Parliament was not in Session,
the President promulgated the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998 (19 of
1998) on the 31st October, 1998. It is proposed to replace the Companies
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1998 by a Bill which, inter alia provides for the
following matters :(a) to declare Infrastructure Development Finance Company
Limited as public financial institution;(b) to provide for nominated facility
to the holders of shares, debentures and fixed deposit holders;(c) allowing
the companies to buy-back their shares subject to certain safeguards;(d) to
provide for transfer of certain sums to the capital redemption reserve account
when a company purchases its own share out of free reserve;(e) to provide for
issue of sweat equity subject to fulfilment of certain conditions;(f) to
provide for establishment of Investors Education and Protection Fund;(g) to
provide for constitution of National Advisory Committee on accounting
standard;(h) to provide for compliance of accounting standards by a company in
preparation of profit and loss account and balance-sheet; and(i) to permit the
companies to make inter-corporate investments and loans subject to fulfilment
of certain conditions without prior approval of the Central Government.3\. The
corporate sector is going through difficult times. The capital market is also
at low ebb, which requires immediate morale boosting efforts on the part of
the Government to promote investors' confidence. Be sides, the economy needs
certain impetus for promoting inter-corporate investments considering slow
flow of funds in new investments. In order to overcome these adverse
conditions faced by the corporate sector, it was felt that the company should
be permitted to buy-back their own shares, to make investments or loans freely
without prior approval of the Central Government, to provide for nomination
facility to the holders of shares, deposits and debentures and also to make
provision in law for establishment of Investors Education and Protection Fund
broadly on the line of provisions contained in the Companies Bill, 1997.4\. In
the present Bill, as compared to the Ordinance promulgated, some further
changes have been made in order to make some of the legal provisions more
simple, practical and specific and to remove ambiguity in respect of some
other provisions. Broadly, the changes are as follows :(a) buy-back of shares
has been restricted to twenty-five per cent. of the paid-up capital and the
funds used for this purpose are not to exceed twenty-five per cent. of the
paid-up capital and free reserves. Free reserves have been defined for the
purpose of buy-back;(b) restriction of twenty-four months, after the buy-back,
for further issue of securities will apply only in respect of issue of the
same security. The Company will have no restriction to issue other securities
during this period;(c) prior approval of financial institutions in case of
investment/loan/guarantee up to sixty per cent. of the net worth will not be
required if there is no default in repayment of loan/interest to public
financial institutions;(d) company shall not be allowed to make any inter-
corporate investment if there is a default in repayment of deposits or
interest thereon. Restrictions on Inter corporate Investment will also not
apply in case of wholly owned subsidiary companies or companies established
with object of financing industrial enterprises and for subscribing to right
shares;(e) in case of corporate guarantee, the companies would be permitted to
obtain ex-post-facto approval of the shareholders within a specified
period;(f) the powers to the Board of Directors to decline or to suspend
registration of shares in case of a nominee have been withdrawn;(g) for
transfer of unclaimed funds from company to Investor Protection Fund, the
period has been increased from five years to seven years and thereafter no
claim to be entertained;(h) for issue of sweat equity, a special resolution
has been provided instead of ordinary resolution.5\. The Bill seeks to replace
the said Ordinance. - Gazette of India, 22-12-1998, Pt. II - Section 2, Ext.,
P. 16 (No. 50).Act 53 of 2000.- The Government introduced a comprehensive
Companies Bill, 1997 in Rajya Sabha on 14-8-1997 and the same was referred to
Standing Committee of Parliament for examination and report thereon. The
process of examination, however, is not yet over and is still to take some
more time. The passing of this Bill is thus likely to be delayed further. It
is however considered desirable by the Government that some more important
changes in the Companies Act, 1956 are brought out in order to provide
immediately certain measures for good corporate governance and for protection
of investors. These measures are as follows :(i) to provide a minimum paid-up
capital of Rs. 1 lakh for private companies and Rs. 5 lakh for public
companies;(ii) to delete provisions relating to deemed public companies;(iii)
to reduce the period for disbursing dividend/interim dividend to shareholders
from 42 days to 30 days;(iv) to request the companies to inform Company Law
Board within sixty days if the company fails to make repayment of deposits on
maturity to small deposit holders and the Company Law Board would be enabled
to consider these defaults reported by companies and make an order within
thirty days which the company shall be bound to comply with. A company which
fails to report or comply with the order of the Company Law Board shall be
punishable for imprisonment which may extend to three years and shall also be
liable to fine or a fine of not less than Rs. 500 per day during which such
default continues;(v) to provide that the Securities and Exchange Board of
India be entrusted with powers with regard to all matters relating to public
issues and transfers including power to prosecute defaulting companies and
their directors;(vi) to include a Directors' Responsibility Statement in the
Board's report to highlight the accountability of directors in good corporate
governance;(vii) to provide that public listed companies with paid-up capital
of Rs. 5 crores or more shall be required to set up an Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors as a measure for better corporate governance;(viii) to
require companies with paid-up capital of Rs. 10 lakh or more and which do not
have whole-time Secretary in their employment to submit a Secretarial
Compliance Certificate from Company Secretary in whole-time practice;(ix) to
delete the provisions for appointment of public trustee by Central Government
with a view to enabling the Trust to directly exercise the voting power;(x) to
provide that any offer of shares or debentures to more than 50 persons shall
be treated as public issue with suitable modification in the case of public
financial institutions and non-banking financial companies;(xi) to prescribe
voting through postal ballot in case of only important items with effect from
such date as may be notified by the Government to ensure good corporate
governance;(xii) to empower Regional Director to allow change of registered
office of companies from jurisdiction of one Registrar of Companies to another
Registrar of Companies within the same State;(xiii) to employer the
Comptroller and Auditor-General of India to appoint the auditors in respect of
Government Companies and also to provide that shareholders of such companies
will fix their remuneration in annual general meeting;(xiv) To provide that in
case of a public company which does not file annual accounts and annual
returns continuously for three years, the directors of such company will be
debarred from becoming the director of other public companies for five years.
Similarly, in case of any public company which fails to repay its depositors
on maturity of deposit amount/debentures, dividend and interest on
deposits/debentures on due dates, the whole-time directors of defaulting
companies as on such date will be debarred from becoming a director of any
other public company for a period of five years;(xv) to provide that for
purpose of managerial remuneration, the amount of depreciation will be the
same as provided in Profit and Loss Account of the Company;(xvi) to provide
that no person can hold office of director in more than fifteen companies at a
time;(xvii) to provide for appointment of one director as a nominee of small
shareholders who constitute a minimum of 1000 in number and having shares of
not more than Rs. 20,000 with effect from the date to be specified and subject
to such other conditions as may be prescribed by the Central
Government;(xviii) to provide penal provisions for increased fine for offences
under the Act;(xix) to provide that a shareholder of the company be
disqualified for appointment as auditor of the company;(xx) to delete the
provisions relating to managing agents, secretaries and treasurers as they
have become redundant after abolition of the system of managing agent,
secretaries and treasurers;(xxi) to provide that private limited companies
shall be excluded in reckoning the number of companies which an auditor can
audit.

### 2. It is expected that the above amendments in a short Bill will ensure
better corporate governance, transparency in working of companies and also
ensure more effective enforcement by enhancing the penalty/punishment for
contravention so as to ensure better compliance of the provisions of the
Companies Act, 1956.

### 3. Notes on clauses explaining in detail the provisions of the Bill. -
Gazette of India, 23-12-1999, Pt. II - Section 2, Ext., P. 34 (No. 39).

Act 11 of 2003.- The latest developments and innovations in Corporate laws
required that the Companies Act, 1956 and other related laws concerning
winding up of companies should be remodelled in line with the international
practices in this field. Government constituted a Committee consisting of
experts under the chairmanship of Justice V. Balakrishna Eradi, retired
Supreme Court Judge to examine the law relating to insolvency and winding up
of companies.2\. The Committee examined Companies Act, 1956 and also other
laws having a bearing on the subject such as Sick Industrial Companies
(Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA), Recovery of Debts due to Banks and
Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act,
1956; it also considered laws on corporate insolvency prevailing in
industrially advanced countries. The Committee held wide ranging hearings and
consultations on the subject.3\. On the basis of the recommendations of the
Committee the present Bill has been prepared with the main objective of
facilitating or expending revival/rehabilitation of sick companies and
protection of workers interests and where necessary, winding up of companies.
The salient features of the Bill are as follows :(i) A National Company Law
Tribunal will be set up. The powers and jurisdiction presently being exercised
by various bodies viz., Company Law Board or Board for Industrial and
Financial Reconstruction or Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction or High Courts will now be consolidated and entrusted to the
Tribunal. Thus, multiplicity of litigation before various Courts or quasi-
judicial bodies or forums regarding revival or rehabilitation or merger or
amalgamation or winding up will be avoided as all these matters will be heard
and decided by the proposed National Company Law Tribunal;(ii) All the parties
will be bound by the Tribunal's orders and in case of non-availability of a
workable proposal for revival or rehabilitation etc, the Tribunal can decide
the matter on merits including introduction of its own scheme;(iii) The
Tribunal shall work through Benches. There shall be ten special benches which
will deal with the matters relating to revival or reconstruction or
rehabilitation or winding up of companies;(iv) This will reduce the entire
process which is presently taking several years in winding up of the companies
to about two years or so;(v) Stripping of assets of sick companies will be
avoided;(vi) Since individual affidavits will be filed with National Company
Law Tribunal which will have powers of contempt of Court, there will be an in-
built seriousness;(vii) There will be a fund known as Rehabilitation and
Revival Fund which will be used to make primarily :(a) interim payment of the
dues of workmen of the company which has been declared sick or is under
liquidation;(b) protection of the assets of sick companies;(c) revival and
rehabilitation of sick companies.(viii) `Industrial Undertaking' in terms of
sickness does not include :(a) small scale industrial undertakings, as defined
in clause (j) of section (3) of the Industrial (Development and Regulation)
Act, 1951;(b) Public Sector Undertakings, unless a reference is made by the
Central Government and/or State Government, as the case may be.(ix) As a
result of this enactment everyone including workers, creditors, investors and
the economy as a whole will stand to benefit.4\. The Bill seeks to achieve the
above objectives.5\. The Notes on clauses explain, in detail, provisions of
the Bill. - Gazette of India, 30-8-2001, Pt. II - Section 2, Ext., P. 45 (No.

other act, manifested its intention that the debentures shall be cancelled;the
company shall have, and shall be deemed always to have had, the right to keep
the debentures alive for the purposes of re-issue; and in exercising such a
right, the company shall have, and shall be deemed always to have had, power
to re-issue the debentures either by re-issuing the same debentures or by
issuing other debentures in their place.(2)Upon such re-issue, the person
entitled to the debentures, shall have, and shall be deemed always to have
had, the same rights and priorities as if the debentures had never been
redeemed.(3)Where with the object of keeping debentures alive for the purpose
of re-issue, they have, either before or after the commencement of this Act,
been transferred to a nominee of the company, a transfer from that nominee
shall be deemed to be a re-issue for the purposes of this section.(4)Where a
company, has either before or after the commencement of this Act, deposited
any of its debentures to secure advances from time to time on current account
or otherwise, the debentures shall not be deemed to have been redeemed by

the debentures remained so deposited.(5)The re-issue of a debenture or the
issue of another debenture in its place under the power by this section given
to, or deemed to have been possessed by, a company, whether the re-issue or
issue was made before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be treated
as the issue of a new debenture for the purposes of stamp duty, but it shall
not be so treated for the purposes of any provision limiting the amount or
number of debentures to be issued:Provided that any person lending money on
the security of a debenture re-issued under this section which appears to be
duly stamped may give the debenture in evidence in any proceedings for
enforcing his security without payment of the stamp duty or any penalty in
respect thereof, unless he had notice or, but for his negligence, might have
discovered, that the debenture was not duly stamped; but in any such case the
company shall be liable to pay the proper stamp duty and penalty.(6)Nothing in
this section shall prejudice-(a)the operation of any decree or order of a
Court of competent jurisdiction pronounced or made before the twenty-fifth day
of February, 1910, as between the parties to the proceedings in which the
decree or order was made;(b)where an appeal has been preferred against any
such decree or order, the operation of any decree or order passed on such
appeal, as between the parties to such an appeal; or(c)any power to issue

extinguished, reserved to a company by its debentures or the securities for
the same.

subject to the charge, then, if the company is not at the time in course of
being wound-up, the debts which in every winding-up are, under the provisions
of Part VII relating to preferential payments, to be paid in priority to all
other debts, shall be paid forthwith out of any assets coming to the hands of
the receiver or other person taking possession as aforesaid in priority to any
claim for principal or interest in respect of the debentures.(2)In the
application of the provisions aforesaid, section 530 shall be construed as if
the provision for payment of accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable on
the termination of employment before or by the effect of the winding up order
or resolution were a provision for payment of such remuneration becoming
payable on the termination of employment before or by the effect of the
appointment of the receiver or possession being taken as aforesaid.(3)The
periods of time mentioned in the said provisions of Part VII shall be reckoned
from the date of appointment of the receiver or of possession being taken as
aforesaid, as the case may be.(4)Where the date referred to in sub-section (3)
occurred before the commencement of this Act, sub-sections (1) and (3) shall
have effect with the substitution, for references to the said provisions of
Part VII, of references to the provisions which, by virtue of sub-section (9)
of section 530, are deemed to remain in force in the case therein mentioned,
and sub-section (2) shall not apply.(5)Any payments made under this section
shall be recouped, as far as may be, out of the assets of the company
available for payment of general creditors.

of the contract, or otherwise as the [Tribunal] [ Substituted by Act 11 of

thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property in, or the delivery
of the property to, any person entitled thereto or to whom it may seem just
that the property should be delivered by way of compensation for such
liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the
[Tribunal] [ Substituted by Act 11 of 2003, Section 95, for " Court" .] thinks

commencement of the winding-up; or(b)if the [Tribunal] [ Substituted by Act 11
of 2003, Section 95, for " Court" .] thinks fit, subject only to the same
liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that person
at that date, and in either event (if the case so requires) as if the lease
had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order; and any
mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms
shall be excluded from all interest in and security upon the property, and, if
there is no person claiming under the company who is willing to accept an
order upon such terms, the [Tribunal] [ Substituted by Act 11 of 2003, Section
95, for " Court" .] shall have power to vest the estate and interest of the
company in the property in any person liable, either personally or in a
representative character, and either alone or jointly with the company, to
perform the lessee's covenants in the lease, freed and discharged from all
estates, encumbrances and interests created therein by the company.(7)Any

Projected Reveunuefrom Intangible Asset (C) | = |  Total ProjectedRevenue from the Intangible Asset as provide to the ProjectLender at the time of financial closure/agreement.  
  
The amortization amount or rate should ensure that the whole ofthe cost of hte
intangible asset is amortized over the concessionperiod.Total Revenue shall be
reviewed at the end of each financial yearand the projected revenue shall be
adjusted to reflect any changes inthe estimate which will lead to the actual
collection at the end ofthe concession period.
