blasting which are not safety fuses, tubes for firing explosives, containing
their own means of ignition.Note. - The expression "ammunition containing its
own means of ignition" means ammunition having an arrangement, whether
attached to or forming part of the ammunition which is adapted to explode or
fire the ammunition by friction or percussion. "Percussion cap" does not
include a detonator.Class 7 - Fireworks Class(1)Fireworks Class has four
divisions, namely, Division 1, Division 2, Division 3, and Division
4.(2)Division 1 comprises fireworks composition that is to say, any chemical
compound or mechanically mixed preparation of an explosive or inflammable
nature, which is used for the purpose of making manufactured firework, and is
not an explosive of classes 1,2,3,4,5 & 6, any star and any coloured fire
composition:Provided that a substantially constructed hermetically closed
metal case, containing not more than 500 grammes of coloured fire composition
of such a nature, as not to be liable to spontaneous ignition shall be deemed
to be "a manufactured firework" and not a "firework composition".(3)Division 2
fireworks comprises manufactured fireworks i.e. to say any explosive of class
1,2,3,4 or 6 and any fireworks composition when such explosive or composition
is enclosed in any case or contrivance or other articles specially adapted,
for the production of pyrotechnic effect for pyrotechnic signal or sound
signals.(4)Division 2 fireworks comprises 3 sub-divisions, namely, Sub-
division 1, Sub-division 2 and Sub-division 3.(5)Sub-division 1 of Division 2
fireworks comprises low hazard fireworks which, in the opinion of Chief
Controller are relatively innocuous in themselves and are not liable to
explode violently or all at once e.g. sparklers [Chinese crackers, serpents,
etc.](6)Sub-division 2 of Division 2 of fireworks comprises high hazard
fireworks which, in the opinion of Chief Controller, present a special hazard
to a person e.g. rockets, shells, maroons, wheels, barrages, fountains,
illumination pieces, distress signals, pyrotechnic devices etc.(7)Sub-division
3 of Division 2 fireworks comprises such fireworks, which are assembled at
site purely for the purpose of display.(8)Division 3 comprises any explosive
contrivance required for the manufacture of manufactured fireworks e.g. quick
match fuse, micro cord fuse etc.(9)Division 4 comprises manufactured fireworks

Class"Liquid Oxygen Explosives" means an absorbent carbonaceous material such
as wood pulp, carbon black, metal powder, coal dust, etc. impregnated with
liquid air or liquid oxygen with or without the addition of other substances.

## Part 2  UN CLASSIFICATION OF EXPLOSIVES

As per the United Nations recommendations in the Model Regulation on the
Transport of Dangerous Goods published vide ST/SG/AL.10/1/ Rev 12 in ISBN 92
-1-13974-5, the U N Classification of dangerous goods have been made as U N
Class 1(Explosives), Class 2 (Gases), Class 3 (Flammable liquid), Class 4
(Flammable Solids; substances liable to spontaneous combustion; and substances
which in contact with water emit flammable gases), Class 5 (Oxidizing
substances; organic peroxides), Class 6 (Poisonous and infectious substances),
Class 7 (Radioactive Materials), Class 8 (Corrosive substances) and class 9
(Miscellaneous dangerous substances).Therefore explosives, which come within
the purview of the Explosives Rules, are hazardous goods of UN Class 1.The UN
Class 1 i.e. explosives, have been further divided into 6 divisions as follows
:

Division 1.1 (UN Class 1 Division 1): |  Substances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard e.g., Gun powder, class 3 explosives, Detonators(ordinary or electric), Detonating fuse, shaped charge, demolition charge, boosters, tetryl, smoke less powder, fireworks composition etc.  
---|---  
Division 1.2 (UN Class 1 Division 2): | Substances and articles, which have a projection, hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.  
Division 1.3 (UN Class 1 Division 3): | Substances and articles, which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both but not, a mass explosion hazard.  
Division 1.4 (UN Class 1 Division 4): | Substances and articles, which present no significant hazard, e.g., practice grenades, Safety fuse, fireworks,  
Division 1.5 (UN Class 1 Division 5): | Very insensitive substances, which have a mass explosion, hazard e.g., noncap sensitive class 2 explosives.  
Division 1.6 (UN Class 1 Division 6): | Extremely insensitive articles, which do not have a mass explosion hazard.  
  
Notes. - (1) For the purpose of safety distances as applicable for
manufacturing factories and magazines,(a)Explosives of "X" category (except
sparklers) can be considered as explosives belonging to U N Class
1.4;(b)Explosives of "Y" category as explosives of U N Class 1.3;(c)Explosives
of "ZZ" category as explosives of U N Class 1.1 and 1.5;(2)For very low hazard
fireworks like sparklers, separate Tables of Safety distances have been
prescribed for manufacturing or storage purpose.

*Alternative pattern for use where hot water is available.N.B. - The apparatus and materials are to comply in all respects with the specification and standard patterns.SPECIFICATION - ACID, ACETICThe acetic acid is to be clear, colourless and free from all impurities, and is not to contain less than 96 per cent CH3COOH. When 1 cubic centimetre. Of N/10 potassium permanganate solution is added to 100 cubic centimetres of the acetic acid maintained at 15oC, the distinctive colour is to remain for not less than 15 minutes.One drop of the diluted acetic acid-one volume acetic acid diluted with four volumes of distilled water-when placed by means of a glass rod on freshly-prepared potassium iodide-starch paper is to produce no colour.SPECIFICATION - CHALK, FRENCHThe French chalk is to be equal in colour, to the standard sample and is not to contain more than 0.5 per cent of moisture.The bulk of the French chalk is to be such that a volume of 50 cubic centimetres. will weigh 23.5 + 1.0 grammes. This to be determined as follows :A glass funnel, the stem of which is 11 centimetres in length tapering, internally from 8 mm. at the top to 5 mm. at the end, is to be clamped vertically above a 50 cubic centimetres cylinder so that the mouth of the latter is 7 centimetres. Below the lowest point of the funnel. The cylinder is to be 2.5 centimetres. in internal diameter, with a ground edge. The French Chalk is to be poured gradually into the funnel and allowed to flow into the cylinder until the latter overflows. This should take one minute. The surface of the chalk is then to be levelled off, without tapping into the funnel and allowed to flow into the cylinder until the latter overflows. This should take one minute. The surface of the chalk is then to be levelled off, without tapping or shaking the cylinder, by drawing a straight edge over the mouth of the cylinder. The cylinder and contents are then to be weighed.The fitness of the French chalk is to be such that it will all pass, without rubbing, through a 0.075 mm. wire sieve of 6.400 meshes per square centimetre.The French chalk is not to contain more than 0.1 per cent of soluble alkali salts calculated as CaCo3. This is to be determined as follows:

### 10\. grams of the chalk are to be boiled with 250 cubic centimetres of
water for one minute, filtered, washed and the filtrate titrated with N/10
hydrochloric acid.

The French chalk, when warmed with hydrochloric acid is not to give off more
than 1 per cent and not less than 0.25 per cent of carbonic acid gas.The
French chalk is not to absorb more than 0.5 per cent of moisture after being
dried at 100C till constant in weight, and then exposed under a bell-jar to
saturated atmosphere at 15C to 20C for 24 hours.Note. - Before use in heat-
test experiments the French chalk is to be carefully washed with distilled
water, dried in a water oven at 65-70C, and exposed to a saturated atmosphere
for 24 hours. It is to be kept in a well-stoppered bottle.SPECIFICATION -
GLYCERINEThe glycerine is to comply with the latest edition of British
Pharmacopoeia Specification in all respects.SPECIFICATION - PAPER, FILTERSThe
paper for making heat test paper is to consist entirely of pure normal cotton
cellulose of strongly resistant quality and free from any loading or
sizing.During manufacture, the paper is not to be submitted to artificial heat
of any kind.The paper is to have a smooth white surface, and both sides are to
be as nearly alike as possible.The average length of the fibres is to be 2 
0.5 millimetres.The sheets, when measured with a Ciceri smith's patent fixed
pressure micrometer, are to have a thickness of 1.8  0.2 millimetres.The last
treatment in its preparation is to be a thorough washing with pure distilled
water and subsequent air drying in a pure atmosphere.The paper is to be free
from all traces of chemical or other impurity particularly acids, chlorine and
peroxides.On boiling with 3 per cent, caustic soda solution for 60 minutes,
the paper is to lose more than 7.5 per cent of its weight.When heated for 15
minutes at 100C with Fehlings's solutions, diluted with twice its volume of
boiling water, it is not to produce more than 1.25 per cent of its weight of
cuprous oxide (Cu2O).It is to be supplied in sheets 50 centimetres. long by 15
centimetres. wide, and each 100 sheets packed separately in a hermetically
sealed tin case closed by a tear-off strip.For use in the extraction of nitro-
glycerine from dynamite it is to be supplied in circles 5.5 centimetres in
diameter, each 100 papers being packed separately.SPECIFICATION - PAPERS,
TESTThe papers are to be prepared and tested by the method laid down in
Appendix II.Each batch of papers is to be tested by carrying out four
consecutive tests of four papers on each of two days. The mean test obtained
is to be 18.5  0.75 minutes. A test different from the mean by more than two
minutes is to be considered abnormal, and is to be disregarded unless there
are more than one of such abnormal tests amongst the 32 papers tested, in
which case the batch is to be condemned.SPECIFICATION - PAPERS, STANDARD
TINTThe standard tint papers are to be made by the method described in, and
are to conform to the conditions laid down in Appendix I.II - PREPARATION OF
THE SAMPLE TO BE TESTEDAll the operations in preparing a sample for testing
are to be carried out as expeditiously as possible, avoiding exposure to
light, as far as practicable and the test is to be carried out as soon as the
sample is prepared.In weighing out heat test quantities, an accuracy of  0.05
gramme is sufficient. These quantities are to be weighted out into test tubes
which have been fitted with rubber rings, the lower surface of which coincides
with the bottom line etched on the test tube.Explosives of Class 3, Division 1
:(1)Friable Nitro-glycerine preparations from which the nitro-glycerine or
liquid nitro-compound cannot be conveniently extracted with water-(a)A
cartridge of the sample to be tested is to be opened at one end and rotated
with one hand while with the other contents of the cartridge are to be
loosened by means of pressure between the thumb and forefinger. The first 12.7

APPLICATION OF THE LIST(a)The water bath is to be fitted up and is to be
levelled and filled with water up to the outflow. It is to be placed on a
table of convenient height in such a position that the heat test tint can
readily be observed by reflected light. No part of the apparatus to be exposed
to direct sunlight.(b)The thermometer fixed in the rubber stopper, is to be
inserted in the wire cage provided for the purpose on the under side of the
water bath of 7.6 centimetres. The water is heated to the required
temperature, and maintained at a constant temperature and depth. The
temperatures for the various explosives are given in Table I.(c)The glass rod
with platinum wire hook is to be inserted in the rubber stopper. A test paper
is then to be removed from the brown glass bottle by means of the forceps
placed on the glass plate so that its edges coincide with the lines on the
plate, and pierced by passing the needle through the paper and the hole in the
plate. The test paper is then to be held by means of the forceps, and a
mixture of equal volumes of distilled water and glycerine is to be applied to
the upper edge of the test paper by means of the glass rod of the dropping
bottle in sufficient quantity to moisten the upper half of the test paper by
the time the test is complete. The platinum wire hook of the glass rod is then
to be passed through the hole in the paper. At no time is the operator to
touch the paper with his finger.(d)The rubber stopper carrying the glass rod
and test paper is at once to be firmly pressed into the test tube containing
the explosives to be tested until the bottom of the stopper coincides with the
top line etched on the test tube and the position of the glass rod is to be
adjusted, so that the lower edge of the wet portion of the test paper, which
edge is to be approximately horizontal, coincides with the middle etched line
on the test tube. The test tube is then to be inserted in one of the wire
cages of the lid of the water bath, so that the bottom line etched on the test
tube coincides with the upper surface of the lid. The rubber ring is to
pressed down on the bath and the cap placed in position over the tube.The
quantities of the various explosives to be placed in the test tube are given
in Table I.The test paper is not to be inspected by lifting the cap until
shortly before the time explosive ought to stand the test as given in Table
I.(e)The test is completed when the faint brown line, which after time makes
its appearance at the margin between the wet and the dry positions of the test
paper, equals in depth of tint the brown line on the standard tint paper.For
any given explosives to pass the test, the time elapsing between the
introduction of the tube into the bath and the production of the tint equal to
the standard must not be less than the time given in table below :

After the test is finished, the explosive is to be carefully removed from the
tubes, and the tubes thoroughly washed out with tap water by means of the test
tube brush. They are then to be rinsed out and allowed to drain for a few
minutes. The washing is repeated with distilled water, the tubes rinsed,
allowed to drain, and finally dried in a bath at 100C. The tubes are to be
allowed to cool to the ordinary temperature before being used again.IV -

PAPERS0.48grammes of the finest yellow ochre, 0.2 gramme of raw umber and 5
grammes of fine white gum arabic, all of which have been very finely ground in
an agate mortar are weighed into a stoppered bottle of about 150 cubic
centimetre capacity and 100 cubic centimetre of water added. The whole is
shaken in the cold until the gum is dissolved. The suspension is then well
shaken and allowed to stand for one hour.A stylographic pen is then filled
from the centre of the suspension and with the aid of a ruler lines are drawn
at a steady pace across one side, of a sheet of filter paper to Specification
D. The sheet is then cut up into rectangular strips 1 centimetres broad by 2
centimetres long, each with a line across the middle perpendicular to the
length of the strip. The breadth of the line must be not less than 0.5
millimetres. not more than 1 millimetres.In order to maintain continuity as
regards depth of tint strips in which the tint does not correspond with that
of the sealed pattern are to be rejected.APPENDIX 2 TO SCHEDULE IIIPREPARATION
AND TESTING OF HEAT PAPERSPREPARATIONPotassium Iodide:The purest potassium
iodide obtainable commercially is to be purified by triple re-crystallisation
from pure ethyl alcohol, diluted by the addition of one-twentieth of its
volume of distilled water. The crystals are to be kept as small as possible,
and are to be spread out on clean filter paper, resting on a glass plate, and
allowed to dry in the dark. When dry, they are to be placed in a thin layer on
the bottom of a platinum crucible and heated to a dull red heat for one minute
over a spirit lamp burning pure alcohol. When cold the crystals are to be
transferred to a brown glass stoppered bottle from which the quantities
required are to be weighed out.The potassium iodide used for each batch of
filter paper is to be prepared as above immediately before use.Starch:The
starch used is to be best maize starch in the form of cornflower. It is to be
purified immediately before use by washing six times by decantation with
freshly distilled water. It is then to be placed on a porous plate of unglazed
porcelain, allowed to dry in a warm atmosphere in the dark, and stopped in a
brown bottle from which the quantities required are to be weighted
out.Preparation of the Dipping Solution:

### 220. cubic centimetres of freshly distilled water are to be placed in a
Jena glass flask and raised to boiling point over a spirit lamp burning pure
spirit. 3 gram of the starch, prepared as above, are to be suspended in 30
cubic centimetre of distilled water and the mixture poured into the 220 cubic
centimetres of boiling water, with continuous shaking. The whole is to be kept
boiling gently, and shaken occasionally for 5 minutes. The solution of starch
so prepared is to be added to a solution of 1 gramme of the purified potassium
iodide in 250 cubic centimetre of freshly distilled water, and the solution
well mixed. The mixture is to stand overnight in a dark room. The following
day, the clear supernatant liquid is to be carefully siphoned off and used
immediately for dipping the paper.

If it is desired to dip a large batch of paper, the foregoing quantities may
be multiplied in order to obtain sufficient solution.Dipping the papers:The
clear potassium iodide and starch solution is to be poured into a porcelain
tray, which is to be kept exclusively for this operation. Sheets of filter
paper to Specification D are to be passed through it singly, so that all
except 3 centimetres at the end of the strip of paper passes beneath the
surface of the liquid.The strip of paper is to be held above the tray by the
dry portion and a glass rod passed down each side to remove the excess of
solution. It is then to be suspended by the undippened portion in a warm dark
room, cupboard, or oven until dry.It is advisable to nip a small piece, out of
the edge of each sheet at the boundary line between the wet and dry portions
as a guide in subsequent cutting.Cutting and Trimming the Test Paper:In
cutting and trimming heat test paper the operator is to wear clean cotton
gloves.When the sheets are dry they are to be trimmed by cutting off the
unclipped end about 0.5 centimetre below the edge of the undipped portion, 0.5
centimetres strips are also cut from the other three edges. The sheets are
then to be stored in amber coloured glass jars, kept in the dark.When a batch
of paper has been passed for issue the sheets are to be cut up into
rectangular pieces 1 centimetre by 2 centimetres, and are to be issued in this
form.All the above operations are to be carried out in a building specially
reserved for this work. This building is to be protected from the direct
access of the sun's rays, and is, as far as possible, to be kept dark.TESTING
OF HEAT TEST PAPER BY THE DIFFUSION TESTApparatus and Materials required:

No. |  | Pieces  
---|---|---  
1. | Acheson graphite, | 1  
2. | Acid, Sulphuric, normal solution | Sufficient supply  
3. | Annulus aluminium | 2  
4. | Cap, light-tightpaste board | 1  
5. | Cylinder, glass, with rubber stopper | 1  
6. | Cylinder, measuring 100 cubic centimetres | 1  
7. | Ferrous ammonium sulphate | Sufficient supply  
8. | Jar, cylindrical, brown glass | 1  
9. | Pipette 10 cubic centimetres | 1  
10. | Rod, stirring, glass | 1  
11. | Sodium nitrite solution containing 1.7 grams in 1 litre | Sufficient supply  
12. | Stopper, rubber, with 4 platinum hooks | 1  
  
Application of the Test:The solution is to be brought to 15C before use. 2
grammes of ferrous ammonium sulphate are weighed out and placed in the glass
jar, 90 cubic centimetres of the normal sulphuric acid added and solution
effected by stirring with the glass rod. The jar is then placed in a bath of
water at 15C, and must be kept at the temperature of the air should be 15C
to 17C. 10 cubic centimetres of the sodium nitrite solution are then added by
means of the pipette and well stirred in. An aluminium annulus is placed
centrally over the mouth of the jar and the orifice covered by the graphite
slab; over this is placed a second annulus. Good contact between surfaces is
to be ensured by exerting a slight pressure and twisting motion.The glass
cylinder with rubber stopper and light tight cap are then placed on the second
annulus, and the assembled apparatus is allowed to stand for 20 minutes. After
the expiration of the 20 minutes, the light tight cap and the glass cylinder
are removed, the rubber stopper taken out of the cylinder waved several times
through the air. As soon as possible, four of the heat test papers to be
tested are moistened with glycerine solution, placed on the platinum hooks of
the stopper, the stopper inserted in the cylinder, and the cylinder and light
tight cap again placed in position of the second annulus, and the time
noted.When the papers read by reflected light reach the standard, tint, the
time is again noted; the difference gives the time of test. Standard tint
papers to be read by reflected light are used for comparison.The cylinder is
then removed uncorked, waved several times through the air, and a fresh set of
papers is at once put on for test. After four sets of tests have been made the
graphite slab must be heated to 200C for 1 hour allowed to cool in an
evacuated desiccators over potash for at least 16 hours before being used
again.A batch of papers is to be tested by carrying out four consecutive tests
of four papers on each of two days.

process buildings should be such that an explosion in one building does not
initiate explosion in another through blast, shock, or missiles and it should
cause no or little damage to personnel or property in such other buildings.
Therefore the safety distances for different quantities of the different
catagories of explosives (X, Y and ZZ) under Explosives Rules, are classified
in three types viz. Inter Process Distance (IPD) between process buildings,
Middle Safety Distance (MSD) from process buildings to facilities like
highways, railways, navigable waterways, dams or reservoirs etc. and Outside
Safety Distance (OSD) from process buildings to outside property, which may be
built-up or inhabited, have been prescribed in the Tables 1, 2 and 3 in
Schedule VIII annexed to these rules.B. Layout of facilities: The layout of
different buildings should be made observing at least the minimum safety
distances prescribed and taking the maximum advantage of the natural
topography. Hill slopes and dense forests serve as natural protection. The
difference in the ground level in a hilly area can be utilized with advantage
in placing sensitive explosives buildings concealed or protected with very
little additional traversing being necessary. Explosive buildings on a flat
ground or on a plateau with built up area downhill are not at all desirable
for the same reason.C. Construction:(a)Roof and Walls - Process buildings are
constructed of strong but light walls and strong roof. Cement brick walls 22.5
centimetres thick and 15 centimetres RCC roofs are recommended. The light
wall, in case of an explosion, creates light missiles, which can be contained
by the vertical inner face traverse provided all-round. In some cases when the
force of explosion can be safety and easily let off through one side, one of
the four walls may be very weak. Examples are nitration buildings with the
weak side facing an hill slope or forest and detonator press cubicles with
back side open. The strong roof intercepts missiles from another exploding
building, which may otherwise be falling through the roof initiating an
explosion. The RCC slab roof also can come down and smoother the effects of
explosion when the same takes place dislodging and breaking the walls.(b)Doors
- Process buildings should have easily accessible doors opening outwards
except in case of nonmanned remote controlled rooms. Each process building
shall have adequate number (minimum 2) of exits for quick escape of personnel
in the event of a mishap. The doors should be of wood painted with a suitable
fire resistant paint.(c)Windows-ventilators: Number and size of windows and
ventilators shall be decided on the basis of actual requirements. Frames may
be of steel or wood. No exposed iron or steel is allowed. It should be either
galvanized or adequately covered with paint. Iron frames is not preferred
where acid fumes are likely to corrode or explosive dust may accumulate in
cracks and crevices. The glass panes for the windows and ventilators should be
wired glass type.(d)Surface and finishing - The floor, wall and ceiling should
be finished smooth and free from cracks and crevices. Depending on the nature
of chemicals handled, special protection on floor and lower wall may be
necessary. Mastic floor or antistatic rubber matting on floor is essential in
some cases. In chemical plants the drains for taking out liquor and washing
shall have chemical resistant plastic or mastic lining.

### 2\. Traverses

A. Types of traverses:The most commonly used traverses are natural angle
traverse (NAT) of earthen mounds for storage buildings and vertical inner face
traverse (VIFT) for process buildings. The traverses should be at least 2.4
metres wide at the explosives stack level. The minimum width at the top is 1.5
metres for VIFT and 1 metre for NAT, the top being at least 0.6m above the
explosives stack level. The tow of the traverse should not be more than 1 to
1.5 metres away from the building to be protected. If more clearance becomes
essential, the height of the traverse is to be increased proportionately
maintaining the same angle of protection. The inner face of the VIFT is a
vertical masonry wall, strong enough to bear the load of the earth filling at
the back.A semi VIF traverse is similar to VIFT except that above the stack
level, the inside surface is inclined and not vertical reducing the top
thickness to 1 metre.B. Sectional view showing types of traverses:The
construction of the buildings and traverses are required to be strictly as per
the specifications. There is no scope for any compromise in the material and
dimensions. RCC roof or wall with reinforcement only for namesake, a traverse
located at 5m or farther from the building or a VIFT with little earth behind
the vertical wall serve no purpose.C. Internal Wall as Traverse:Buildings
handling small quantity of explosives can be effectively traversed by its own
walls of adequate construction. The following table shows the recommended wall
thickness for different quantities of explosives.

Weight of explosives kilogrammes | RCC wall (preferred thickness) millimetres | Brick wall thickness millimetres  
---|---|---  
5 | 225 | 340  
7 | 225 | 450  
12 | 225 | 570  
18 | 300 | 700  
35 | 450 | Not permitted  
50 | 600 | Not permitted  
  
D. Partition Walls :A processed building having several rooms or compartments
can have partition walls of adequate dimensions and constructions. Such walls
can delay substantial transmission of explosion from one side to the other
side of the wall, thus preventing simultaneous detonation. The wall thickness
for different quantities of explosives are given in the table below:-

Weight of explosives in kilogrammes | Wall thickness in centimetres for preventing of reinforcement by volume [The wall if made of brick should be twice the thickness of RCC wall with 0.2% reinforcement.]  
---|---  
| 0.20% | 0.5% | 0.7%  
0\- 75 | 10 | 10 | 10  
75-100 | 15 | 15 | 10  
100-150 | 20 | 20 | 15  
150-200 | 25 | 25 | 20  
200-250 | 30 | 25 | 25  
250-300 | 30 | 30 | 25  
300-350 | 35 | 35 | 30  
  
The safety distance of such a process building having rooms or compartments
separated by partition walls as above can be based on the explosive content of
any of the compartment, which is the largest.

### 3\. Explosive Limit-Person Limit:

Limiting the quantity of explosives handled in a building and the number of
persons employed therein are obviously to reduce the adverse effects of an
explosion. It is desirable that the minimum quantity of explosives and the
minimum number of persons absolutely necessary for an operation or process
should only be allowed in the relevant building from the point of view of
safety.The recommended limit on quantity of explosives and number of persons
shall also depend on the sensitivities and properties of explosives handled.
In case of sensitive initiating explosives the limits should be as low as
possible. For keeping the reasonably low, it may be necessary to divide an
operation into several sub-operations in different buildings.SPECIFICATION - 2
: SPECIFICATIONS OF MAGAZINES OTHER THAN THAT OF FIREWORKS

### 1\. General:

The basic considerations in the construction of magazines are security to
ensure that the contents are kept out of the hands of unauthorised persons, to
maintain them in good conditions and to reduce the risk of accidental
explosion. This calls for a construction, which will resist illegal entry as
much as possible and is well ventilated. In choosing a site for a magazine,
consideration should be given to protection of life and property offered by
natural features of the ground in the event of a fire and/or an explosion. The
suitability of a site and the amount of explosives that may be stored are
determined by its distance from public thoroughfares; residential or
industrial areas, railways etc. as specified in the table of safety distance
in Schedule VIII. Naturally a site obscured from public view either by natural
or artificial means is preferred.Apart from the rules and regulations
concerning the storage of explosives, certain conditions should be observed
from the point of view of care for the materials concerned for example,
improper storage may lead directly to misfires later on. In all cases, places
of storage should be dry, well ventilated and protected from extremes of
temperature as much as possible. Stocks should be drawn upon in strict
rotation. Any surplus from the day's work being returned to the magazine
should be kept separately for use on the following day.Safety Fuse and
detonators should be kept in perfect condition for obtaining good results.
Therefore, at all times during transport, handling and storage, they should be
protected from moisture and contact with oil, grease, kerosene or other
liquids. Detonators shall not be stored with other explosives.

TABLE OF SAFETY DISTANCESThe following safety distances shall be observed in
the factories licensed for manufacture of explosives or from the magazines
licensed for storage of high explosives. If the quantity of explosives to be
stored is in between any two stages shown in the table, the safety distance
required for higher stage should be observed.Notes. - (1) When two or more
storage magazines are located on the same property, each magazine must comply
with the minimum distances specified from inhabited buildings, railways, and
highways, and, in addition, they should be separated from each other by not
less than the distances shown for "Separation of Magazines," except that the
quantity of explosives contained in cap magazines shall govern in regard to
the spacing of said cap magazines from magazines containing other explosives.
If any two or more magazines are separated from each other by less than the
specified "Separation of Magazines" distances, then such tow or more
magazines, as a group, must be considered as one magazine, and the total
quantity of explosives stored in such group must be treated as if stored in a
single magazine located on the site of any magazine of the group, and must
comply with the minimum of distances specified from other magazines, in
habited building, railways, and highways.(2)This Table applies only to the
