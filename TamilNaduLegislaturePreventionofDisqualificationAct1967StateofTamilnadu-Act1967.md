Tamil Nadu Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1967(Tamil Nadu
Act 3 of 1967)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Legislature
(Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1967 (Tamil Nadu Act 3 of 1967). -
Before the promulgation of the Madras Legislature (Prevention of
Disqualification) Ordinance, 1966 (Madras Ordinance 4 of 1966), the only
statutory provisions in force in this State providing for the removal of
disqualification for membership of the State Legislature, were section 11 of
the Madras Payment of Salaries and Removal of Disqualifications Act, 1951
(Madras Act XX of 1951), and section 17(1) of the Madras Home Guard Act, 1963
(Madras Act 3 of 1963). According to the provisions mentioned above, the
office of Parliamentary Secretary or membership of the National Cadet Corps,
Territorial Army, Air Defence Reserve or Auxiliary Air Force or Home Guard was
not considered to be a disqualification for membership of the State
Legislature. Any other office of profit under Government would disqualify its
holder for membership of the State Legislature. The corresponding law
applicable to membership of Parliament is the Parliament (Prevention of
Disqualification) Act, 1959 (Central Act 10 of 1959). The Central Act is
comprehensive in nature and covers membership of statutory as well as non-
statutory bodies. It was considered that the law applicable to membership of
the State Legislature should be more comprehensive and that the subject should
be dealt with in a separate enactment, repealing the provisions bearing on
this topic in the 1951 and 1963 Madras Acts. The matter had assumed urgency
just on the eve of the general elections. As the Legislature was not in
session, the Ordinance was promulgated with a view to enable persons who might
be members of the various bodies to stand for elections without their
eligibility being questioned on the ground that they hold any office of profit
under Government.2\. The Bill seeks to replace the above Ordinance by an Act
of the Legislature.Published in Part IV-Section 3, pages 7-10 of the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extra-ordinary, dated the 25th March, 1967.Statement
of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Legislature (Prevention of
Disqualification) Amendment Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 46 of 1971). - According
to section 2 of the Tamil Nadu Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification)
Act, 1967 (Tamil Nadu Act 3 of 1967), none of the offices specified in the
Schedule to the said Act shall disqualify or shall be deemed ever to have
disqualified, the holder thereof for being chosen as, or for being, a member
of the Legislative Assembly or of the Legislative Council. Subsequent to the
enactment of this Act, certain Committees and Boards were constituted by the
Government of Tamil Nadu and the Government of India for various
administrative purposes. The Joint Committee on Offices of Profit (set up by
the Government of India) has recommended that the membership, secretaryship or
chairmanship of these bodies ought not to disqualify for Membership of
Parliament. There maybe persons from the State of Tamil Nadu in these bodies
who are Members of the State Legislature or who intend to seek election to the
Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council. Hence, it has been decided
that all these Committees and Boards should be included in the Schedule to the
Tamil Nadu Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1967, to ensure
that the membership or secretaryship or chairmanship of these bodies will not
disqualify the holders thereof for being chosen as, or for being a member of
the Legislative Assembly or of the Legislative Council of Tamil Nadu.2\. The
