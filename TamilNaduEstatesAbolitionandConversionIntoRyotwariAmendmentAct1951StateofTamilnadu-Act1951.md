Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion Into Ryotwari) Amendment Act,
1951(Tamil Nadu Act 17 of 1951)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras
Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Amendment Act, 1951 (Tamil
Nadu Act XVII of 1951). - Section 54-B of the Madras Estates (Abolition and
Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (Madras Act 26 of 1948), provides that if
the aggregate of the amounts of compensation payable in respect of all
zamindari estates falls short of twelve and a half crores of rupees, an amount
equal to the sum by which the aggregate so falls short should be distributed
among the zamindari estates pro rata. The section, as it stands, refers only,
to zamindari estates but not to under-tenure estates. Post-settlement under-
tenure estates have always been regarded as part and parcel of the principal
zamindari estates, and although they are placed in a separate category for the
purposes of this Act, the intention was clearly not to make them ineligible
for the additional compensation provided for in section 54-B. It is,
therefore, proposed to amend that section so as to make post-settlement under-
tenure estates also eligible for additional compensation-See clause 2(i) of
the Bill.Published in Part 1V-A (pages 362-364) of the Fort St. George Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 24th August 1950.Published in Part-IV-A of the Fort.
St. George Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 24th August 1951.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into
Ryotwari) Amendment Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 18 of 1961). - The object of the
present Bill is to make certain amendments to the Madras Estates (Abolition
and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (Madras Act XXVI of 1948), to get over
certain practical difficulties experienced in the settlement of estates. The
amendments empower the Director of Settlements to review his orders
determining the basic annual sum and total compensation under section 39(1) of
the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, if they
are vitiated by any clerical or arithmetical mistake or error apparent on the
face of the record, or, if, subsequent to the passing of the Order, data for
the better calculation of the basic annual sum have become available, or, if
the order requires to be modified in pursuance of the final order of any
competent authority or Court. The review order of the Director of Settlements
will be subject to appeal and revision by the Board of Revenue in the same way
as his orders under section 39(1).2\. The Bill also seeks to amend the
Schedule to the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari)
Amendment Act, 1951, in order to rectify a mistake that had crept in respect
of two villages, Aradaiendal and Pooranathanendal.Published in Part IV-Section
1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 25th January
