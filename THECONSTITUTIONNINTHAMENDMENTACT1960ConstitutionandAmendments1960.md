### 6. Assam-East Pakistan Boundary.

(i)The dispute concerning Bagge Award III has been settled by adopting the
following rational boundary in the Patharia Forest Reserve region:From a point
marked X (H522558) along the Radcliffe Line BA on the old Patharia Reserve
Boundary as shown in the topographical map sheet No. 83D/5, the boundary line
shall run in close proximity and parallel to the cart road to its south to a
point A (H531554); thence in a southerly direction up the spur and along the
ridge to a hill top marked B (H523529); thence in a south-easterly direction
along the ridge down the spur across a stream to a hill top marked C
(H532523); thence in a southerly direction to a point D (H530517); thence in a
south-westerly direction to a flat top E (H523507); thence in a southerly
direction to a point F (H524500); thence in a south-easterly direction in a
straight line to the mid-stream point of the Gandhai Nala marked G (H540494);
thence in south-westerly direction up the mid-stream of Gandhai Nala to point
H (H533482); thence in a south-westerly direction up a spur and along the
ridge to a point I (H517460); thence in a southerly direction to a point on
the ridge marked J (H518455); thence in a south-westerly direction along the
ridge to a point height 364 then continues along the same direction along the
same ridge to a point marked K (H500428); thence in a south and south-westerly
direction along the same ridge to a point marked L (H496420); thence in a
south- easterly direction along the same ridge to a point marked M (H499417);
thence in a south-westerly direction along the ridge to a point on the bridle
path with a height 587; then up the spur to the hill top marked N (H487393);
then in a south-easterly and southerly direction along the ridge to the hill
top with height 692; thence in a southerly direction down the spur to a point
on Buracherra marked O (H484344); thence in a south-westerly direction up the
spur along the ridge to the trigonometrical survey station with height 690;
thence in a southerly direction along the ridge to a point height 490
(H473292); thence in a straight line due south to a point on the eastern
boundary of the Patharia Reserve Forest marked Y (H473263); along the
Radcliffe Line BAThe line described above has been plotted on two copies of
topographical map sheets Nos. 83D/5, 83D/6 and 83D/2.The technical experts
responsible for the ground demarcation will have the authority to make minor
adjustments in order to make the boundary alignment agree with the physical
features as described.The losses and gains to either country as a result of
these adjustments with respect to the line marked on the map will be balanced
by the technical experts.

### 3\. EXTRACTS FROM THE AGREEMENT ENTITLED "AGREED DECISIONS AND PROCEDURES
TO END DISPUTES AND INCIDENTS ALONG THE INDO-WEST PAKISTAN BORDER AREAS",
DATED THE 11TH DAY OF JANUARY, 1960.

### 1\. West Pakistan-Punjab border.-Of the total of 325 miles of the border
in this sector, demarcation has been completed along about 252 miles. About 73
miles of the border has not yet been demarcated due to differences between the
Governments of India and Pakistan regarding interpretation of the decision and
Award of the Punjab Boundary Commission presented by Sir Cyril Radcliffe as
Chairman of the Commission. These differences have been settled along the
lines given below in a spirit of accommodation:

(i)The Sarja Marja, Rakh Hardit Singh and Pathanke (Amritsar- Lahore
border).-The Governments of India and Pakistan agree that the boundary between
West-Pakistan and India in the this region should follow the boundary between
the Tehsils of Lahore and Kasur as laid down under Punjab Government
Notification No. 2183-E, dated 2nd June, 1939. These three villages will in
consequence, fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Government of
Pakistan.(iv)Suleimanke (Ferozepur-Montgomery border).-The Governments of
India and Pakistan agree to adjust the district boundaries in this region as
specified in the attached Schedule and as shown in the map appended thereto as
Annexure I.[The Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Act, 1960, clarified the extent
of Parliament’s power to reduce the area of a state and addressed the issue of
ceding Indian territory to foreign nations. In accordance with the Indo-
Pakistan Agreement of 1958, the amendment made it easier for India to cede the
land of the Berubari Union to Pakistan. However, the West Bengal government
did not agree to the agreement, and the matter was subsequently taken to the
Supreme Court. The court declared that the transfer of Indian territory to a
foreign country was not within Parliament’s authority to reduce a state’s
area, as outlined in Article 3 of the Indian Constitution. Nonetheless, the
amendment helped to resolve conflicts by redrawing the boundaries and
adjusting the territorial claims of each state. Important verdict under this :
