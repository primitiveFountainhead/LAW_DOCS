Tamil Nadu Maritime Board Act, 1995(Tamil Nadu Act 4 of 1996)Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Maritime Board Act, 1995 (Tamil Nadu Act 4 of
1996). - In the existing system of Minor Ports Organisation and the Minor
Ports in the State, -(1) there has been no progress either in terms of income
or quantum of cargo handled since few years;(2) the minor ports have remained
the same basically as it was a few years back;(3) the shipping and concept of
vessels took entirely new turn and minor ports are not geared up to their
needs;(4) there has been paucity of funds and absence of major industry;(5)
with the liberalisation policy, cargo import or export are bound to
increase;(6) the shipping business is taking sea changes and port sector
should be able to grasp and raise to the needs lest the minor ports may have
to be closed;(7) the function of ports is basically for fulfilling the social
objective of overall improvement of the State;(8) the present set up of the
minor port as a Government department cannot deliver the requirements as it
has to depend only on Government budget even for small funds.2\. The formation
of a Maritime Board will satisfy the major requirements and effectively render
the performance of the proposed minor or private ports in a more efficient
manner due to the following reasons, namely :-(a) set up of a Board is broad
based representing various interests;(b) it can attract private capital
easily;(c) it will have its own power to raise funds as loans on its own
assets;(d) specialised knowledge of technical, legal, financial can be had
exclusively owing to set up of Board;(e) for commercial aspect, a statutory
committee is available for the Board for obtaining a clear understanding;(f)
decision about privatisation of port or part of the ports can easily be taken
under the set up of a Board rather under a Government department;(g) levying
various charges will be in realistic forms and hence commerce will be
attracted;(h) it will attract private capital and private participation
without which there is no future for the minor ports.3\. Accordingly, the
Government have decided to establish a statutory Board for the purpose,
namely, the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the
above decision.Published in Part IV - Section 1, page 190 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 8th November 1995.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Maritime Board (Amendment Act, 1997 (Tamil
Nadu Act 15 of 1997). - The Tamil Nadu Maritime Board Act, 1995 (Tamil Nadu
Act 4 of 1996), provides for the constitution of a Maritime Board with ten
Members, of which seven are non-officials. There is no scope in the said Act
for appointment of officials of Government Departments and undertakings,
connected with ports and shippings, as Members of the said Board. For
effective management of the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board, the Government have
decided to appoint the senior officials of the Government Departments and
Undertakings connected with Ports and Shipping as Members with the Minister of
Transport, who is in charge of the Ports, as Chairman of the said Board.2\.
The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board
Act, 1995 (Tamil Nadu Act 4 of 1996) suitably for the purpose.3\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in Part IV - Section 1 of
the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 31st January
1997.Received the assent of the President on 11th February 1996 and published
