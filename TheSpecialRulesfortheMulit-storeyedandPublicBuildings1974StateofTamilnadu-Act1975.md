*. The lower value of 250 Kg./M2 should be taken where separate storage facilities are provided and the higher value of 400 Kg./M2 should be taken where such provisions are lacking.Explanation 1. - A reference to a "floor" includes a reference to any part of that floor, and a reference to "slabs" includes boarding and beams or ribs spaced not further apart than one metre between centres, and a reference to "beams" means all other beams and ribs.Explanation 2. - Under loading class No. 250, the reference to light work rooms envisages rooms in which some light machines (for example, sewing machines used by milliners or tailors) are operated without a central power driven unit that is, the machines are independently operated either by hand or by small motors. Under loading class No. 400, the reference to "workmen" generally envisages the installation of machines operated with a central power driven unit, with the individual machines being belt driven.Explanation 3. - "Fixed sealing" implies that the removal of the seating and the use of the space for other purposes is improbable. The maximum likely load in this case, is, therefore, closely controlled.Explanation 4. - The loading in workshops, warehouses and factories varies considerably and so three loadings under the terms "light", "medium" and 'heavy' are introduced in order to allow for more economical designs but the terms have no special meaning in themselves other than live load for which the relevant floor is designed. It is however, important particularly in the case of heavy weight loads, to assess the neutral loads to ensure that they are not in excess of 1,000 Kg/M2, in cases where they arc in excess, the design shall be based on the actual loading.Explanation 5. - The load classification for stairs, corridors, balconies and landings provide for the fact that these often serve several occupancies and are used for transporting the furniture and goods.(b)Live loads on roofs. - Allowance for live load on flat roofs, sloping roofs and curved roofs shall be as given in the following Table :-Live Load on Floors

Types of floors | Live had measured on plan | Minimum live load measured on plan  
---|---|---  
(1) | (2) | (3)  
Flat slopping or curved roof with slopes up toand including 10 degrees---(a) Access Provide | 150 Kg/m2 |  375 Kg. uniformly distributed over any span ofone metre width of the roof slab and 900 Kg uniformly distributedover the span in the case of all beams.  
(b) Access not provided except for maintenance. | 75 Kg/m2 |  190 Kg. uniformly except for distributed overany span of one metre width of the roof slab and 450 Kg.uniformly ; distributed over the span in the case of beams.

Curved roofs with slope at springing greaterthan 10 degrees. |  (75-345 r3) Kg/m2where rh/1. h = the height of the highest point of the structuremeasured from its springing ; and 1 = chord width of the roof ifsingly curved and shorter of the two sides if doubly curved. | Subject to a minimum of 40 Kg/m2  
  
Note. - For special types of roofs with highly permeable and absorbent
material, the contingency of roof material increasing in weight due to
absorption of moisture shall be provided for.(c)Impact and variations. - For
structures carrying live loads which induce impact or vibrations, the live
load shall be increased as follows:-(i)For frame supporting lifts and hoists
100 per cent.(ii)For foundations, footings and piers supporting lifts and
hoisting apparatus-40 per cent.(iii)For light machinery, shaft or motor
units-20 per cent, minimum,(iv)For reciprocating machinery or power units-50
per cent, minimum.

### 3\. Wind load. - The wind load on a building shall be calculated on the
basis of the basic wind pressure, given in the following Table, which is the
equivalent static pressure in the direction of flow of wind :-

(a)Basic Wind pressure for the City. -

Height in meters | Pressures in Kg/m2

For intermediate heights, interpolated values may be adopted.(b)Wind pressure
on roofs. - For flat and porched roots, the wind pressures and sections normal
to the surface due to wind blowing at right angles to the ridge shall be
determined by multiplying the basic wind pressure (p) with the factors given
in the Table below:-Wind Pressure on Roofs(Wind Normal and Ridges)

as stipulated in the National Building Code of India, 1970, shall be ta ken
into account while designing the structures.Appendix-C

### 1\. Types of Construction

1.0General. - The design of any building and the type of materials used in its
construction are important factors in making the building resistant to a
complete burnout and in preventing the rapid spread of fire, smoke or fumes,
which may otherwise contribute to the loss of lives and property.The fire
resistance of building or its structural elements is expressed in hours
against specified test load which is expressed in kilo calories per metre
square and against a certain intensity of fire. The fire resistance test for
structure shall be done in accordance with the recommendation of the National
Building Code, 1970. For the purpose of National Building Code, the types of
construction according to fire resistance shall be classified into four
categories, namely, Type 1 construction, Type 2 construction, Type 3
Construction and Type 4 Construction. The fire resistance of structural
components of each type of construction shall be in accordance with the
recommendation of the National Building Code, 1970.Note 1 : In Type 1
Construction, All Structural Components Shall Be 4 Hour Fire Resistance;Note 2

extends to more than one fire zone, it shall be deemed to be in the fire zone
in which the major portion of the building or structure is situated.2.4.2.
When any building is so situated that it extends equally to more than one fire
zone, it shall be deemed to be in the fire zone having more hazardous
occupancy buildings.2.5Temporary Buildings2.5.1. Temporary buildings shall be
permitted only in the fire zones No. 1 and No. 2, as the case may be,
according to the purpose for which these are to be used, by special permit
from the authority (i.e. the Commissioner, Corporation of [Chennai]

the fire fighting facilities available.3.1.2. Maximum floor area. - The
maximum permissible area in terms of floor area ratios for different groups of
occupancies and different types of construction shall be according to Table 1
below.3.1.2.1. Each portion of a building which is separated by one or more
continuous fire resisting walls, having a fire resistance of not less than 4
hours, extending from the foundation to 1 m above the roof at all points may
be considered to be a separate building for the calculation of maximum
permissible height and floor areas, provided that openings, if any, in the
separating wall arc also protected by fire assemblies.Floor Area Ratios for

Exceptions and deviations. - In case of practical difficulty or to avoid
unnecessary hardship without sacrificing reasonable safety, the authority,
i.e., Commissioner, Corporation of [Chennai] [Substituted for the word
'Madras' by Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1996.] or Government, as the case may be,
exempts from the National Building Code.3.1.11. Surface finishes3.1.11.1. The
use of flammable surface finishes on walls and ceilings affects the safety of
the occupants of a building. Such finishes tend to spread the fire and even
though the structural elements may be adequately fire resistant, serious
danger to life may result. It is essential therefore to have adequate
precaution to minimize spread of flame on wall and ceiling surfaces.3.1.11.2.
The susceptibility to fire of various types of all surfaces is determined in
terms of the rate of spread of fire. Based upon the rate of spread of fire,
surfacing materials shall be considered as divided into four classes as
follows :-Class 1 : Surfaces of very low flame spread. - Those surfaces on
which not more than 19 cm. effective spread of flame occurs.Class 2 : Surfaces
of low flame spread. - These surfaces on which the effective spread of flame
neither exceeds 30 cm. during the first 19 minutes nor exceeds a final value
of 60 cm.Class 3 : Surfaces of medium flame spread. - Those surfaces on which
the effective spread of flame neither exceeds 30 cm. during the first 19
minutes nor exceeds 85 cm. during the first 10 minutes.Class 4 : Surfaces of
rapid flame spread. - Those surfaces on which the effective spread of flame
exceeds 30 cm. during the first 1-1/2 minutes or exceeds 85 cm. during the
first 10 minutes.3.1.11.3. The situation in which materials failing into
various classes shall be used in house construction is given below :-

Class 1 | Class 2 | Class 3  
---|---|---  
(1) | (2) | (3)  
  
May be used in any situation except on walls and ceilings of staircases and
passages. Should be used only in living rooms and bedrooms (but not rooms in
the roof) and only as a lining to solid walls and partitions. Not on staircase
or corridors.3.1.11.4. Materials of Class 4 which include untreated wood fibre
boards may be used as ceiling linings, provided the ceiling is at least 2.3 m
from the upper surface of the floor below, and the wall surfaces conform with
requirements of Class 1, Class 4 materials shall not be used in kitchens,
passages and staircases. Some types contain bitumen and in addition to risk
from spread of fire emit dense smoke on burning; such materials shall be
excluded under these conditions.3.1.11.5. When frames, walls, partitions or
floors are lined with combustible materials, the surfaces on both sides of the
materials shall conform to the appropriate class because there is considerable
danger from fire starting and rapidly spreading within the concealed cavity
unknown to the occupants whose escape may be hampered thereby.3.1.12.
Glazing3.1.12.1. Building of types 1 to 4 construction shall employ one of the
two types of glazing described in 3.1.12.2. and 3.1.12.3. except that type 4
construction may have the alternative of hardwood sashes of frames or
both.3.1.12.2. Wired glass shall comply with the following
requirements:-(a)Thickness of glass. - The thickness of glass shall be not
less t ban 6.5 mm.(b)Embedded wire netting. - Embedded wire netting shall be

not exceed 2,500 cm.(d)Sashes and frames. - The sashes or frames or both shall
be entirely of iron or other hard metal securely bolted or keyed into the wall
except in the case of panels in internal doors.(e)Setting of glass. - The
squares of glass shall be set in rebates or grooves not less than 6.5 mm. in
width or depth with due allowance for expansion and shall be secured by hard
metal fastenings to the sashes or frames independently of any lead, cement or
putty used for weather propping purposes.3.1.12.3. Electro copper glazing
shall comply with the following requirements:-(a)Thickness of glass shall be
not less than 6.5 mm.(b)Size of squares of glass shall not exceed 100
cm.(c)Section lights. - The square glasses to be formed by electro copper
glazing into sectional lights shall not exceed 0.37 m. in area.(d)Sashes and
frames. - The sashes or frames or both shall be entirely of iron or other hard
metal, securely bolted or keyed into the wall except when in panels in

allowances for expansion and shall be secured by hard metal fastenings to the
sashes or frames independently of any lead, cement or putty used for weather
proofing purposes.3.1.12.4. No wall opening exceeding 5 m. be deemed capable
of efficient protection by wired glass or electro copper glazing.3.1.12.5.
Hard metal casements not exceeding 0.8 m. fitted with wired glass or electro
copper glazing in accordance with 3.1.12.2. and 3.1.12.3. secured to the
frames by hard metal hinges not more than 60 cm. apart and by fastenings at
top, centre and bottom shall be permissible.3.1.13. Skylights3.1.13.1. Wired
