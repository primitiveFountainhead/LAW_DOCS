period (excluding Ad-hoc service) to complete probation in the grade or
post.(2)The period of probation may, if the appointing authority deems fit, be

departmental or legal proceedings pending against the employee, exceed one
year.(3)During the period of his probation an employee may be required to
undergo such departmental training and pass such departmental tests as the
appointing authority may, from time to time, specify in this behalf.

### 20. Confirmation of Employees on Probation.

(1)General(i)Confirmation will be made only once in the service of an employee
which will be in the entry grade.(ii)Confirmation is delinked from the
availability of permanent vacancy in the grade. In other words an officer who
has successfully completed the probation may be considered for
confirmation.(2)Confirmation in the grade to which initially recruited(i)As at
present, the appointee should satisfactorily complete the probation.(ii)The
case will be placed before DPC (for confirmation).(iii)A specific order of
confirmation will be issued when the case is cleared from all angles.(3)On
Promotion(i)If the recruitment rules do not prescribe any probation, an
officer promoted on regular basis (after following the prescribed DPC, etc.,
procedure) will have all the benefits that the person confirmed in that grade
would have.(ii)Where probation is prescribed, the appointing authority will on
completion of the prescribed period of probation assess the work and conduct
of the officer himself and in case the conclusion is that the officer is fit
to hold the higher grade, he will pass an order declaring that the person
concerned has successfully completed the probation. If, work of the officer
has not been satisfactory or needs to be watched for some more time, he may
revert him to the post or grade from which he was promoted, or extend the
period of probation as the case may be.Since there will be no confirmation on
promotion before an official is declared to have completed the probation
satisfactorily, a rigorous screening of his performance should be made and
there should be no hesitation to revert a person to the post or grade from
which he was promoted if the work of the officer during probation has not been
satisfactory.Confirmation of probationers: A person appointed against a
permanent post as a direct recruit with definite conditions of probation is to
be confirmed in the grade with effect from the date on which he successfully
completes the period of probation. The decision whether he should be confirmed
or his probation extended should be taken soon after the expiry of the initial
probationary period, i.e., ordinarily within 6 to 8 weeks and communicated to
the employee together with the reasons in case of extension. Even though the
meetings of the DPC may be held after the termination of the period of
probation of direct recruits, a person appointed against a permanent post with
definite conditions of probation is to be confirmed in the grade with effect
from the date on which he successfully completes the period of probation. A
probationer who is not making satisfactory progress or who shows himself to be
inadequate for the service should be informed of his shortcomings well before
the expiry of the original probationary period so that he can make severe
efforts at self-improvement.In the case of probation, the DPC should not
determine the relative grading of officers but only decide whether they should
be declared to have completed the probation satisfactorily. If the performance
of any probationer is not satisfactory, the DPC may advise whether the period
of probation should be extended or whether he should be discharged from
service.

### 21. Discharge or Reversion of Employees on Probation.

(1)If an employee on probation in his first appointment is not considered fit,
on the basis of his conduct or performance, for confirmation at the end of the
period of probation prescribed in regulation 19, he shall be discharged from
the service of the Board.(2)If an employee on probation who holds a lien on a
post and does not complete the period of probation as specified under
Regulation 19 to the satisfaction of the appointing authority, he may be
reverted to the post on which he holds a lien.(3)If an employee during the
period of probation on a post is considered unfit for further retention in
that post on the basis of performance or conduct or failure to pass the
departmental test if prescribed, he shall be liable to be discharged from
service at anytime if he has no lien on any post or reverted to the post in
which he holds a lien.

### 22. Departmental Test for Promotion, Confirmation in Certain Cases.

\- The Chairman may specify, from time to time, the posts, confirmation in or
promotion to which shall be subject to the passing of a qualifying
departmental test, if any. The Chairman may also specify, from time to time,
the details of the qualifying departmental test such as the procedure for
holding the test, the syllabus for the test, the intervals at which the test

candidates, etc.

### 23. Reversion due to Failure in Departmental Test.

\- An employee promoted to a post shall pass such qualifying departmental
test, if any, as may be specified by the Chairman from time to time, within
such period, as may be specified by him failing which the employee shall be
reverted. When the passing of a test is specified as a condition precedent to
promotion to a higher post, no employee shall be considered for promotion to
such a post, until he passes the prescribed test.

### 24. Seniority List.

\- An up-to-date gradation list indicating the inter-se seniority of the
employees shall be maintained for each grade. The list shall indicate
separately the permanent and temporary employees in each grade. The list shall
be circulated every year.

### 25. Fixation of Seniority.

(1)The seniority of persons directly recruited to a grade and persons
appointed on the basis of departmental promotion shall be assigned inter-se
seniority according to rotation of vacancies between direct recruits and
promotees, which shall be based on the quota of vacancies in the grade
reserved for direct recruitment and promotion as indicated in the schedule. In
cases where exchange of vacancies has been resorted to as per Regulation 6,
the seniority will be as per the mode of filling up.(2)Direct recruits shall
be ranked inter-se in the order of merit in which they are placed in the
select list on the basis of their performance in the examination or interview
or both, the recruits of an earlier select list being ranked senior to those
of a later select list.(3)Persons appointed against promotion quota of
vacancies shall be ranked inter-se according to the order in which they are
approved for promotion by the Departmental Promotion

consideration.(2)The following procedure shall be observed while recommending
employees for promotion through selection method:a) The Departmental Promotion
Committee (DPC) shall determine the merit of those being assessed for
promotion with reference to the prescribed benchmark and accordingly grade the
officers as 'fit' or 'unfit'. Only those who are graded 'fit' by the DPC shall

seniority in the feeder grade. Those officers who are graded as 'unfit' by the
DPC shall not be included in the select list.b) The Departmental Promotion

foreign service or on study leave.c) The instructions issued by the Govt. from
