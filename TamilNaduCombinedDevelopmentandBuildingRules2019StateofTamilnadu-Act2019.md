### 1\. Protection from Earthquakes. - (1) In those areas where there are no
dangers of soil liquefaction or settlements or landslides, all building
structures and infrastructures should be designed using the relevant Indian
Standards as provided in these rules and the National Building Code.

(2)Soils subjected to liquefaction potential under earthquake shaking shall be
improved by compaction to desired relative densities, so as to prevent the
possibility of liquefaction.(3)Buildings and structures shall be founded on
deep bearing piles going to non-liquefiable dense layers.(4)Steep slopes shall
be made more stable by terracing and construction of retaining walls and
breast walls, and by ensuring good drainage of water so that the saturation of
the hill-slope is avoided.(5)Any other appropriate engineering intervention
that may be required to save the buildings, structures, or infrastructure from
the fury of the earthquake shall be made.

### 2\. Protection from Cyclonic Wind Damage/Flooding/Tsunami. - (1)
Buildings, structures and infrastructures in the cyclone prone areas shall be
designed according to the Indian Standards and Guidelines as provided in these
rules and the National Building Code.

(2)Light utility structures used for electrical transmission and distribution
and towers for communications, Chimney stacks of industrial structures require
special design considerations against the cyclonic wind pressures, suctions
and uplifts.(3)In case the buildings, structures and infrastructures are
founded on marine clay deposits it will be advisable to adopt either under-
reamed or long piles which shall penetrate the marine clay layer and rest on
dense sand stratum, or individual column footing with a reinforced concrete
beam located at the level of the ground, or a continuous reinforced concrete
strip footing, using a very low bearing pressure.(4)Wherever, the topsoil
could become slushy due to flooding, the top layer of 30cm depth of soil shall
not be considered for providing lateral stability.(5)In storm surge prone
areas, it will be preferable to construct the community structures, like
schools, cyclone shelters, etc. by raising the level of the ground protected
by provision of retaining walls at sufficient distance away from the building,
taken to such depth that no erosion takes place due to receding storm surge.
Alternatively, construct the community structures on stilts with no masonry or
bracing up to the probable maximum surge level.(6)Protection of areas from
floods may require one or more of the following actions:(a)Raising the site
above the high flood level.(b)Construction or improvement of drainage paths to
effectively drain the water from the site area(c)Construction of buildings and
structures on deep foundations going below the depth of scour or on stilts
with deep enough foundations under water.Annexure - XIII[See rule

300 square meter of floor area and part thereof.(3)The Closed Circuit
Television units shall be installed at suitable vantage points such as entry
points, exit points, corridors, reception area, etc., in such a manner that
the movement of the public can be closely surveilled.(4)Every person intend to
construct or reconstruct a public building shall make necessary provision in
the building plan itself for the installation of Closed Circuit Television
units in the manner prescribed in sub-rules (1) and (2), while making
application to the Commissioner or the Executive Authority of the urban local
body concerned for granting of permission for the execution of that
work.(5)The Commissioner or the Executive Authority of the urban local body
concerned shall, before giving permission for the construction of a new public
building or reconstruction of an existing building as a public building ensure
that necessary provisions have been made in the building plan for the
installation of Closed Circuit Television units in the manner as prescribed in

building, shall ensure that the Closed Circuit Television units have been
properly installed in such building in the manner as prescribed in sub-rules
(1) and (2).Annexure - XXII[See rules 35 (5) and 63 (1)]Rainwater
ConservationWater Conservation:A. Rain Water Harvesting. - Effective measures
shall be taken within each premises (roof top and campus) for conservation of
rainwater, and RWH structures to the following standards shall be provided;
the same shall be shown in the plan applied for planning permission.(a)Non
High Rise Buildings - Buildings of height up to 12m. - Following are the
recommended designs that can be adopted in the non High Rise Buildings ie.,
Independent Houses and Apartments with Ground + two floor or Stilt + 3 floors
and not more than 16 dwelling units).(i)In plots that are being
developed/buildings with a dug (source) well, rooftop water to be diverted to
a sump for immediate use (if that is relevant), through a first flush cum
pebble-sand filter combination or a Special filter and the overflow to be
diverted to the source well. The rain falling on the driveway or paved setback
areas (around campus) and from rooftop pipes that are not connected to the
sump or source well to be intercepted near the gate(s) either by means of a
gutter (provided with a perforated lid) or a bump/speed breaker arrangement
and led to a recharge well. (Drawing 1A & 1D).(ii)In plots to be
developed/buildings without an open well, rooftop water to be diverted to a
sump for immediate use (if that is relevant), through a first flush cum
pebble-sand filter combination or a Special filter and the overflow to be
diverted to a recharge well. The rain falling on the driveway or paved setback
areas and from rooftop pipes that are not connected to the sump or recharge
well to be intercepted near the gate(s) either by means of a gutter (provided
with a perforated lid) or a bump/speed breaker arrangement and led to a
recharge well. ( Drawing 1B & 1D)(iii)In plots to be developed/buildings where
the setback area is very small, not enough to dig a recharge well or sewers,
water line, electrical cable running below, rooftop water brought down by
pipes should be led to percolation pits, one per pipe. (Drawing 1C)(b)Non High
Rise Buildings more than 12m height and up to 18.3m heighrand Industries and
Institutional Buildings. - In case of Non High Rise developments, Industries,
Institutional Buildings as mentioned in all the above cases, rooftop water can
be diverted to a sump for immediate use (if that is relevant), through a first
flush cum pebble-sand filter combination or a Special filter that is available
in the market and the overflow to be diverted to either a dug (source) well or
a recharge well depending on the availability of a source well. Depending on
the need and relevance any combination of the above methods can be
chosen.(i)In the above mentioned categories, rain falling on the setback areas
as well as some of the rooftops will flow on the driveway itself and runoff to
the streets and get wasted. This runoff should be intercepted by means of a
bump/speed breaker arrangement constructed in one or more locations within the
premises and discharged into suitably designed recharge well (s) located
nearby.(Drawing 3A.)(ii)Rain falling on the setback areas as well as some of
the rooftops will flow into the storm drains constructed along the periphery
of the building, whose slope will always be towards the gate(s) in order to
discharge the runoff onto the street. This flow within the drain can be
intercepted inside the drain by a baffle wall and injected into several
recharge wells located close to the drain. (Drawing 3B.)(c)High Rise Buildings
(Residential/Commercial)(i)In plots that are being developed/buildings with a
source well, rooftop water to be diverted to a sump for immediate use (if that
is relevant), through a first flush cum pebble-sand filter combination or an
Special filter that is available in the market and the overflow to be diverted
to the source well. The rain falling on the driveway or paved setback areas or
from rooftop pipes not connected to the sump or source well to be intercepted
near the gate(s) either by means of a gutter (provided with a perforated lid)
or a bump and led to a recharge well. ( Drawing 2A & 2D)(ii)In plots to be
developed/buildings without an open well, rooftop water to be diverted to a
sump for immediate use (if that is relevant), through a first flush cum
pebble-sand filter combination or a Special filter that is available in the
market and the overflow to be diverted to a recharge well. The rain falling on
the driveway, paved setback areas, and from rooftop pipes that are not
connected to the sump or recharge well to be intercepted near the gate(s)
either by means of a gutter (provided with a perforated lid) or a bump/speed
breaker arrangement and led to a recharge well. (Drawing 2B, 2C & 2D)B.
Recycling Of Grey Water. - Effective measures shall be taken within each
premise for recycling of Grey water (water used for washing of cloths and
bathing) and structures to the following standards shall be provided, the same
shall be shown in the plan applied for Planning permission.The methodology for
the recycling of Grey water for the uses of Ground water recharge (Drawing 4)
and flushing of toilet (Drawing No.4B).Prepare a soil bed of garden soil whose
area should be at least 2.5 sq ft per each individual. Lay the water-loving
plant at a distance of one foot from each other laterally and longitudinally.
The soil area need not have a regular shape. It can have any shape as long as
the requisite area is provided. But the level of the soil bed should be
uniform so that the grey water will spread over the entire bed and soil over
the entire area is available for cleaning the water. If there are slopes,
water will tend to flow more in the lower areas alone and the purification
will be incomplete. The plants must receive at least moderate amount of
sunlight so that they will grow in a healthy manner.The plants should be
watered with fresh water for two or three weeks till they take root and are
stabilised and then the grey (used) water should be diverted to it in
progressively increased volumes over a week. Thereafter, the process is
practically self-sustaining. (Drawing 4A)If the treated water is to be
physically recovered, a sump has to be built for this purpose. The treated
water can then be pumped to the relevant compartment of the overhead tank or
to an exclusive tank, for flushing. If there is excess of treated water, the
overflow can be connected to a suitable water recharge structure. (Drawing
