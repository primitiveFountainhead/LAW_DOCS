scientific names of families are for reference only. They are intended to
indicate the species within the family concerned that are included in the
Appendices. In most cases this is not all of the species within the family.

### 4\. The following abbreviations are used for plant taxa below the level of
species:

(a)"ssp." is used to denote subspecies; and(b)"var(s)." is used to denote
variety (varieties).

### 5\. As none of the species or higher taxa of FLORA included in Appendix I
is annotated to the effect that its hybrids shall be treated in accordance
with the provisions of Article III of the Convention, this means that
artificially propagated hybrids produced from one or more of these species or
taxa may be traded with a certificate of artificial propagation, and that
seeds and pollen (including pollinia), cut flowers, seedling or tissue
cultures obtained in vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile
containers of these hybrids are not subject to the provisions of the
Convention.

### 6\. The names of the countries in parentheses placed against the names of
species in Appendix III are those of the Parties submitting these species for
inclusion in this Appendix.

### 7\. When a species is included in one of the Appendices, the whole, live
or dead, animal or plant is included. In addition, for animal species listed
in Appendix III and plant species listed in Appendix II or III, all parts and
derivatives of the species are also included in the same Appendix unless the
species is annotated to indicate that only specific parts and derivatives are
included. The symbol followed by a number placed against the name of a species
or higher taxon included in Appendix II or III refers to a footnote that
indicates the parts or derivatives of animals or plants that are designated as
'specimens' subject to the provisions of the Convention in accordance with
Article I, paragraph (b), subparagraph (ii) or (iii). Numbers not preceded by
a symbol placed against the name of a species or higher taxon refer to a
footnote that indicates specific conditions or restrictions that are
applicable to trade of such species or higher taxon under the Convention.

### 8\. The terms and expressions below, used in annotations in these
Appendices, are defined as follows:

**Extract** Any substance obtained directly from plant material by physical or
chemical means regardless of the manufacturing process. An extract may be
solid (e.g. crystals, resin, fine or coarse particles), semi-solid (e.g. gums,
waxes) or liquid (e.g. solutions, tinctures, oil and essential
oils).**Finished musical instruments** A musical instrument (as referenced by
the Harmonized System of the World Customs Organization, Chapter 92; musical
instruments, parts and accessories of such articles) that is ready to play or
needs only the installation of parts to make it playable. This term includes
antique instruments (as defined by the Harmonized System codes 97.05 and
97.06; Works of art, collectors' pieces and antiques).**Finished musical
instrument accessories** A musical instrument accessory (as referenced by the
Harmonized System of the World Customs Organization, Chapter 92; musical
instruments, parts and accessories of such articles) that is separate from the
musical instrument, and is specifically designed or shaped to be used
explicitly in association with an instrument, and that requires no further
modification to be used.**Finished musical instrument parts** A part (as
referenced by the Harmonized System of the World Customs Organization, Chapter
92; musical instruments, parts and accessories of such articles) of a musical
instrument that is ready to install and is specifically designed and shaped to
be used explicitly in association with the instrument to make it
playable.**Finished products packaged and ready for retail trade** Products,
shipped singly or in bulk, requiring no further processing, packaged, labelled
for final use or the retail trade in a state fit for being sold to or used by
the general public.**Powder** A dry, solid substance in the form of fine or
coarse particles.**Shipment** Cargo transported under the terms of a single
bill of lading or air waybill, irrespective of the quantity or number of
containers, packages, or pieces worn, carried or included in personal
baggage.**Ten (10) kg per shipment** For the term "10 kg per shipment", the 10
kg limit should be interpreted as referring to the weight of the individual
portions of each item in the shipment made of wood of the species concerned.
In other words, the 10 kg limit is to be assessed against the weight of the
individual portions of wood of Dalhergia/Guibourtia species contained in each
item of the shipment, rather than against the total weight of the
shipment.**Transformed wood** Defined by Harmonized System code 44.09: Wood
(including strips, friezes for parquet flooring, not assembled), continuously
shaped (tongued, grooved, v-jointed, beaded or the like) along any edges, ends
or faces, whether or not planed, sanded or end-jointed.**Woodchips** Wood that
has been reduced to small pieces.For Schedules I, II, III, IV, V and VI to the
principal Act, the following Schedules shall be substituted, (Act No. 18 of

below:This wording, mark or logo must appear on the reverse side of the cloth.
In addition, the selvages of the cloth must bear the words VICUNA [COUNTRY OF
