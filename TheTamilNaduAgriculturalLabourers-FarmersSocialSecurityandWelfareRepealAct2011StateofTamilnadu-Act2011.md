The Tamil Nadu Agricultural Labourers-Farmers (Social Security and Welfare)
Repeal Act, 2011Act No. 13 of 2011Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The
quantum of assistance due to the beneficiaries has been prescribed in the
Schedule to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Labourers-Farmers (Social Security and
Welfare) Act, 2006 (Tamil Nadu Act 29 of 2006) itself. As such, whenever the
quantum of assistance is to be changed, an amendment is required, which makes
the process complicated and cumbersome. Further, as per Section 7 of the said
Tamil Nadu Act 29 of 2006, the Agricultural Labourers-Farmers Welfare Board
shall be responsible for administering the scheme and shall exercise the
powers and discharged the functions, as maybe conferred on it by the scheme.
But, the welfare scheme for agricultural labourers and farmers are implemented
only by the officials of the Revenue Department. Therefore, the role of the
Board for implementation of the welfare scheme is very limited. Moreover, the
constitution of the Board and its non official members under the above said
Act is an additional expenditure to the Government. In 2005, the Tamil Nadu
Chief Minister's Farmers Security Scheme was implemented without the
constitution of a Welfare Board. Further, it has been proposed that the
Farmers Security Scheme will be revamped to suit the present condition and
implemented for providing financial assistances to agricultural labourers,
small and marginal farmers and their familiar in order to provide them with a
social security scheme that will protect them from risk and uncertainty.2\.
The Government have, therefore, decided to repeal the said Tamil Nadu Act 29
of 2006.3\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Vide Bill No.
