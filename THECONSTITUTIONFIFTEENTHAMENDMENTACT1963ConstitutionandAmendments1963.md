**_Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Fifteenth
Amendment) Bill, 1962 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fifteenth
Amendment) Act, 1963_****STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS** Several amendments
to the Constitution have been under consideration for a long time. The
Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in November,
1955, to give effect to some of them. For various reasons, the Bill could not
be proceeded with, and it was allowed to lapse except the one relating to the
amendment of article 3 of the Constitution. This article was amended
separately by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1955. The present Bill
contains some of the proposals included in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment)
Bill and, in addition, there are a few more proposals for amendment of the
Constitution. The proposals relating to articles 276, 297, 311, and 316 of the
Constitution were contained in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill and
they have been adopted with some minor modifications. The new proposals relate
to articles 124, 128, 217, 220, 222, 224A, 226 and entry 78 of the Union List.

### 2. It is proposed to amend article 217 so as to raise the age of
retirement of High Court Judges from sixty years to sixty-two years. When any
question arises to the correct age of a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a
High Court, the question has to be decided by the President. It is proposed to
make the position clear by making a specific provision in articles 124 and
217. It is considered desirable in the public interest that Judges should be
transferred from one High Court to another. Such transfer is expected to
impose additional financial burden on the Judge who is so transferred. It is,
therefore, proposed to pay him some compensatory allowance in addition to his
salary. When a Judge is transferred from one High Court to another, he cannot,
in view of the provisions of article 220, resume practice in any of the High
Courts in which he has held office as a Judge. The provisions of article 220
therefore put a check on the proposal for the transfer of any Judge of a High
Court. It is, therefore, propose d to amend article 220 so that the
restriction regarding resumption of practice should apply only to the High
Court from which the Judge retires, provided that he had served in that High
Court for a period of at least five years immediately before retirement. Such
a provision would facilitate the transfer of Judges. Under the existing
article 226 of the Constitution, the only High Court which has jurisdiction
with respect to the Central Government is the Punjab High Court. This involves
considerable hardship to litigants from distant places. It is, therefore,
proposed to amend article 226 so that when any relief is sought against any
Government, authority or person for any action taken, the High Court within
whose jurisdiction the cause of action arise may also have jurisdiction to
issue appropriate directions, orders or writs. The other new proposals are of
a minor character.

### 3. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill explain the provisions
thereof.

(Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, enabled the High Court to issue writs to any
person or authority even outside the jurisdiction of its terrorist if the
cause of action arises within its territorial boundaries. The High Court
judge’s age of retirement was changed under Article 217. Judges should be
moved from one High Court to another, only if it is deemed to be in the
public’s interest and by consensus. The Judge who is so transferred might
anticipate facing an increased financial burden as a result of this move. So,
according to new clause (2) of Article 222, judges who are transferred from
one High court to another must get compensation.Also Refer]
