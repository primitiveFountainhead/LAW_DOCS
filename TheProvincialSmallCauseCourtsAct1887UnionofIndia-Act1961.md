The Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, 1887(9 of 1887)

### 069.

Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The suits cognizable in Courts of Small
Causes are subject to certain provisos, described in section 6, Act XI of
1865, as "claims for money due on bond or other contract, or for rent, or for
personal property, or for the value of such property, or for damages, when the
debt, damage or demand does not exceed in amount or value the sum of five
hundred rupees whether on balance of account or otherwise" and section 586 of
the Code of Civil Procedure provides that "no second appeal shall lie in any
suit of the nature cognizable in Courts of Small Causes, when the amount or
value of the subject-matter of the original suit does not exceed five hundred
rupees". Since section 6 of the Act of 1865 was enacted, a vast quantity of
case-law has grown up around it, and, as the rulings of the Courts have not
been uniform, doubts constantly arise on the question whether a suit is or is
not a suit of the nature cognizable by a Court of Small Causes, and,
consequently, whether or not, where the suit is of value not exceeding five
hundred rupees and the original decree made in it was not final but was open
to appeal, an appeal will also lie from the appellate decree in the suit. It
appears to the Government of India that the conflicting constructions placed
on section 6, of which some are due to the progress of legislation during the
last twenty years (I.L.R. 3 All. 66), render a more accurate definition
necessary of the suits of which Courts of Small Causes may take cognizance,
and that legislation to this end should follow sections 18 and 19 of the
Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882, in declaring the jurisdiction of
those Courts to extend to all suits of a civil nature, subject to specified
exceptions. This Bill has accordingly been prepared, its primary object being
to remove the doubts now felt as to the effect of section 6, Act XI of 1865;
and, as several sections and parts of sections of that Act have, from time to
time, been repealed and other sections are obsolete as regards both expression
and utility, it has been considered desirable to repeal the Act and re-enact
the substance of the extant portions of it..........[24 th February ,
1887]...An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to Courts of Small
Causes established beyond the Presidency-towns.Whereas it is expedient to

execution, which the Judge might make under this Act.(2)The Judge, in the case
of any decree or order with respect to the execution of which the Registrar

with the provisions of the [Indian Limitation Act, 1877 (15 of 1877)] [Now see

purposes of the [Indian Limitation Act, 1877 (15 of 1877)] [Now see the
