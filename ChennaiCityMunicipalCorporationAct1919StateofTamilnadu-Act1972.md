Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919Act No. 4 of 1919Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Madras City Municipal Corporation and District
Municipalities (Amendment) Act, 1962 (Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1962) - Under the
Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Madras Act IV of 1919) and the
Madras District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Madras Act V of 1920), the ordinary
elections shall take place on such days in the months of August and September
immediately preceding ordinary vacancies. It is proposed to make provisions in
the said Acts to fix dates of ordinary election within three months before the
occurrence of ordinary vacancies and not necessarily in the months of August
and September as at present.2\. It is also proposed to incorporate in the said
Acts provisions in respect of the following matters relating to the holding of
elections on the lines of the provisions made in the Madras Panchayats Act,
1958, namely :-(a) power to extend or reduce the term of office of councillors
as a who for a period not exceeding three months ;(b) power to direct, holding
of any ordinary election even after the occurrence of the vacancies; and(c)
power to postpone or alter the dates of ordinary or casual elections.3\. Under
the provisions of the said Acts, it is obligatory to fill up casual vacancies
except vacancies occurring within three months before the ordinary date of
retirement of councillors. It is considered that it is not necessary to
conduct casual elections to fill casual vacancies arising within a period of
six months prior to the ordinary date of retirement of councillors. It is
accordingly proposed to make provisions in the said Acts for dispensing with
the holding of such casual elections on the eve of ordinary elections.4\. For
the purposes of elections to Municipal Councils and the Corporation of Madras,
the electoral rolls are prepared on the basis of the electoral roll for
territorial constituency of the Madras Legislative Assembly relating to the
municipality or the Corporation. As the names of service electors (Armed
Forces personnel and absentee officers) are included in a separate part of the
electoral roll for the Assembly without specifying their addresses, it is
found difficult to include their names in the electoral rolls prepared under
the said Acts for purposes of election to Municipal Councils and the
Corporation of Madras. It is, therefore, proposed to publish the electoral
rolls relating to municipalities and the Corporation of Madras without
including the names of service electors unless such electors apply for
inclusion of their names in the electoral roll to the authorities concerned by
giving particulars of their addresses in the local area concerned.5\. It is
also considered desirable to incorporate in the said Acts provisions similar
to those contained in the Representation of People Act, 1951 (Central Act
XLIII of 1951) and the Madras District Boards Act, 1920 (Madras Act XIV of
1920) relating to electoral offences and requisitioning of premises, vehicles,
vessels and animals. For the purpose of effectively combating the evil of
personation of voters at municipal elections, it is considered necessary to
make provision in the said Acts for enhanced punishment with a minimum penalty
of imprisonment for a term of not less than six months and fine for the
offence of personation punishable under section 17-F of the Indian Penal
Code.6\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects. Certain
consequential and minor amendments to the said Act have also been
incorporated.Published in Part IV - Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 18th July 1972.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Madras City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu
Act 25 of 2972). - There are at present four classes of officers and servants
under the establishment of the Municipal Corporation of Madras. The council of
the Municipal Corporation of Madras has suggested that appointments to posts
included in Classes III and IV should be made by the commissioner instead of
selection being made by the appointments committee and the appointment being
made by the commissioner as at present. The Government have accepted the
suggestion of the council and have decided to amend section 85 of the Madras
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), suitably for
the purpose.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published
in Part IV-Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated
the 12th August 1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras City Municipal
Corporation and Madurai City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1972
(Tamil Nadu Act 7 of 1973. - Under section 5 of the Madras City Municipal
Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the council of the
municipal corporation of Madras shall consist of one hundred and twenty
councillors. Section 45 of the said Act provides that the city shall be
divided into one hundred and twenty territorial divisions. Sub-section (1) of
section 6 lays down that each of the territorial constituencies of the Tamil
Nadu Legislative Assembly in the city' shall be a circle for the purpose of
the municipal government of the City of Madras. Consequent on the abolition of
the circle and central committees in i971, the council of the municipal
corporation of Madras has suggested (i) to do away with circles and the
principle of equating the circles with the Assembly Constituencies; and (ii)
to increase the number of territorial divisions from 120 to 150. The
Government have accepted the above suggestions and decided to amend the Act.
Consequently, it has also been decided to increase the minimum number of
Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes and women to be 15 and 8 respectively and
also to increase the quorum for the council from thirty-three to fifty.2\.
Sub-section (2)(d) of section 6-D of the Madras City Municipal Corporation
Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919) and sub-section (3)(d) of section 9 of
the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971)
empower the standing committee on accounts to write off only the amount of any
loss of, or any depreciation caused to, the municipal property which in the
opinion of the committee is irrecoverable. There is no monetary limit to write
off in the case of Madras Corporation whereas in the case of Madurai
Corporation the power is restricted only up to Rs. 1,000. As the said
provisions do not empower the said committee to write off any tax, fee or
other amount, whatsoever due to the corporation whether under a contract or
otherwise or any sum payable in connection therewith, if it appears to the
committee to be irrecoverable, it has been decided to amend the Tamil Nadu Act
IV of 1919 and the Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971 accordingly.3\. The Bill seeks to
give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 3 of the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 6th December 1972.Statement

the Corporation of Madras been fixed as five years and six months from the
30th November 1974 with a provision that the State Government may, by
notification, for sufficient cause direct that the period specified shall be
reduced by such period, not exceeding six months as may be specified in such
notification. It has been decided to prepare the Madras Corporation Electoral
Rolls by adapting the relevant Assembly Electoral Rolls as basic roll. The
said Assembly Electoral Rolls have been revised summarily for inclusion of
persons who have attained 21years of age on the 1st January 1980 and published
on the 22nd March 1980. The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly elections have
recently been held. The Madras Corporation Electoral Rolls will have to be
prepared and the elections to the council of Corporation of Madras will have
to be held. The elections to the council of the Corporation of Madras could
not be held before the 31st May 1980.2\. The Government have, therefore,
decided to extend the period within which the Special Officer should make
arrangements for the conduct of elections to the council of the Corporation of
Madras, for a further period of one year from the 31st May 1980. Accordingly,
the Madras City Municipal Corporation Amendment) Ordinance, 1980 (Tamil Nadu
Ordinance 6 of 1980) was promulgated by the Governor to achieve the above
object.3\. This Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part IV-
Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 26th
June 1980.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Local Authorities'
laws (Amendment) Act, 1980 (Tamil Nadu Act 32 of 1980). - Section 47 of the

to be included in such part of the electoral rolls of the Legislative Assembly
Constituency as relates to the municipal corporations, municipalities and
Panchayats shall be entitled to be included in the electoral roll of the
respective local body. The electoral rolls of the Legislative Assembly
Constituencies are those prepared under the Representation of the People Act,
1950 (Central Act XLIII of 1950) and under that Act, persons who are not less
than twenty-one years of age are entitled to be registered in the electoral
roll.2\. Recently, in States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and West
Bengal, the voting age for the elections to the local authorities have been
reduced to eighteen years. An all party leaders meeting was held in the
Secretariat on the 11th July 1980 to discuss about reducing the voting age
from twenty-one to eighteen years for the elections to the local bodies. Most
of the party leaders were in favour of reducing the voting age as eighteen
years from twenty-one. The Government accordingly decided to reduce the voting
age for the elections to the local bodies in this State as eighteen years. 11
has also been decided to fix the minimum age for the contesting candidates in
elections to the local bodies as twenty-one years. It has further been decided
that only those persons who are able to read and write in Tamil shall be
qualified to stand for election as chairmen of Panchayat union councils.3\.
The Bill seeks to achieve the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1
of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 5th August
1980.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras City Municipal Corporation
(Amendment) Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 17 of 1981). - Under sub-section (1) of
section 55-B of the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu
Act IV of 1919), as subsequently amended, the period within which the Special
Officer of the Municipal Corporation of Madras should make arrangements for
the conduct of elections to the council of the Corporation of Madras has been
fixed as six years and six months from the 30th November 1974. The period
expires on the 30th May 1981.2\. The Commissioner, Corporation of Madras, has
been entrusted with the census work. The Government of India have requested
the State Government not to entrust any other important work to the
Commissioner, Corporation of Madras, until the census work is over. The
electoral rolls of the Corporation of Madras can be prepared only after the
census work is over. The elections to council of the Corporation of Madras
could not, therefore, be held before the 30th May 1981.3\. The Government
have, therefore, decided to extend the period within which arrangements should
be made for the conduct of elections to the Municipal Corporation of Madras by
the Special Officer of the Municipal Corporation of Madras for a further
period of one year beyond the 30th May 1981 and to amend the Madras City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 for the purpose, with the existing provision
to reduce the extended period by a period not exceeding six months in case it
is found possible to conduct the elections earlier.4\. The Bill seeks to give
effect to the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 2nd March 1981.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Madras City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1983
(Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1983). - Under sub-section (1) of section 55-B of the

elections to the council of the Corporation of Madras has been fixed as eight
years and six months from the 30th November 1974. The said period will expire
on the 30th May 1983.2\. A policy decision was taken by the Government that
ordinary elections to Panchayats may be conducted first and then to conduct
elections to the municipalities and municipal corporations, so that the
feasibility of introducing the reservation of seats for the members of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and for women in municipalities and
municipal corporations may be examined. A civil appeal challenging the
decision of the Madras High Court upholding the reservations of the office of
presidents of Panchayats and chairmen of Panchayat union councils for the
members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and for women, is now pending
before the Supreme Court. The Government have filed an expedition petition in
the Supreme Court, to fix an early date for the disposal of the case. Apart
from this, before conducting elections to the Municipal Corporation of Madras,
the electoral rolls have to be prepared afresh by house-to-house enumeration
with the 1st January 1983 as the qualifying date. It will take a minimum
period of six months. Hence, it is not possible to conduct the elections to
the municipal corporation of Madras before the 30th May 1983. It has,
therefore, become necessary to extend the period within which arrangements
should be made for the conduct of elections to the municipal corporation of
Madras by the Special Officer of the municipal corporation of Madras beyond
the 30th May 1983.3\. The Government have, accordingly decided to further
extend the said period for one year beyond the 30th May 1983 and to amend the
said Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919)

period by a period not exceeding six months, in case it becomes possible to
conduct the elections earlier.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above

Section 97 of the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act
IV of 1919) empowers the State Government to transfer any officer or servant
of the corporation to the service of any municipality or to transfer any
officer or servant of any such municipality to the service of the corporation.
There is no provision in the said Act empowering the State Government to
transfer any officer or servant of the corporation to the service of other
municipal corporations in the State such as municipal corporation of Madurai
and Coimbatore.2\. Section 114 of the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act,
1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971) empowers the State Government to transfer any
officer or servant of the corporation to the service of the municipal
corporation of Madras or of an)' municipality and vice versa. There is no
provision in the said Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971 empowering the State
Government to transfer any officer or servant of the corporation to the
service of the municipal corporation of Coimbatore.3\. Section 116 of the
Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981)

corporation to the service of the municipal corporation of Madras or to the
municipal corporation of Madurai or to any other municipal corporation that
may be constituted under any law for the time being in force, or to any
municipality and vice versa.4\. Section 73-A of the Tamil Nadu District
Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920) empowers the State
Government to transfer any officer or servant of a municipality to the service
of another municipality, after consulting the municipalities concerned.5\. The
Government consider that with a view to toning up the administration of the
municipal corporations and municipalities in the State and to render better
service to the public, the employees of any one municipal corporation shall be
made liable to be transferred to any other municipal corporation or
municipality and the employees of the municipalities to any of the municipal
corporations which is now in existence and which may be newly constituted and
to any other municipality. It has, therefore, been decided to amend the said
Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919, Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920, Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971
and Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981 to achieve the object in view.6\. The Bill seeks

Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary in the year 1985.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Madras City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1985

Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), as
subsequently amended, the period within which the Special Officer of the
Municipal Corporation of Madras should make arrangements for the conduct of
elections to the council of the Corporation of Madras had been fixed as nine
years and six months from the 30th November, 1974. The said period was due to

cards with or without photographs affixed thereon to all the voters in the
City of Madras, City of Madurai and City of Coimbatore as well as in all the
municipalities and then to conduct civic elections to the Corporation councils
and to the municipal councils. Accordingly, arrangements are being made to
provide the aforesaid identity cards to the voters. It become therefore,
necessary to further extend the period within which the arrangements should be
made for the conduct of elections to the Municipal Corporation of Madras by
the Special Officer beyond the 30th May 1984.3\. The Government accordingly
decided to amend the said Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil

one year beyond the 30th May 1984. To give effect to the above decision, the
Madras City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Ordinance, 1984 (Tamil Nadu
Ordinance 6 of 1984) was promulgated by the Governor and published in the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, Extraordinary, dated the 30th May, 1984.4\. A
Bill to replace the said Ordinance was introduced in the Tamil Nadu
Legislative Assembly on the 9th October 1984, in its session which commenced
on the 8th October 1984. The said Bill was passed in the Legislative Assembly
on the 12th October, 1984. But, the said Bill could not be taken up for
consideration by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council, because the Legislative
Council was adjourned sine die on the 15th October 1984. Subsequently the
Legislative Assembly was dissolved. As such the Bill, as passed by the
Legislative Assembly, could not become an Act of the Legislature to replace
the said Ordinance in time. In view of the circumstances stated above, it
become necessary to promulgate again an Ordinance for the purpose.
Accordingly, the Madras City (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 19 of 1984) was promulgated
by the Governor on the 19th November 1984 and the same was published in the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, Extraordinary, dated the 20th November 1984.
Since the elections to the Council of the Corporation of Madras cannot be
conducted before the 30th May 1985, that is the period within which the
arrangements should be made for the conduct of the elections as extended by
the Tamil Nadu Ordinance 19 of 1984, it has also been decided to extend the

Municipal Corporations of the cities of Madras, Madurai and Coimbatore are due
to expire between the 30th May 1987 and the 29th July 1987. In view of the
above, it has become necessary to extend by one year the period for which the

Municipal Corporations of Madras, Madurai and Coimbatore in April, 1989. The
Municipal Corporation Laws provide eighteen years as the minimum age for

been prepared in accordance with the said Laws. It would take quite a long
time for the preparation of electoral rolls afresh with eighteen years as the
minimum age for voting. Since the Government have decided to conduct elections
to the said Municipal Corporations during April 1989, there is no other
alternative except to hold the elections on the basis of the existing
electoral rolls for the territorial constituencies of the Tamil. Nadu
Legislative Assembly, with twenty-one years as the qualifying age, as relate
to the divisions or wards of the said Municipal Corporations. For this
purpose, the Government have decided to make special provisions applicable

Act, 1992 (Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1992). - Under sub-section (2) of section 3 of
the Tamil Nadu Municipal Councils (Appointment of Special Officers) Act, 1991
(Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1991), Special Officers have been appointed to 98
Municipal Councils except Ambattur Municipal Council to exercise the powers
and perform the functions of the Municipal Councils, the Chairman and of the
Committees established or constituted by or under the Tamil Nadu District
Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920) with effect from the noon
on the 3rd day of March 1991. The term of office of these Special Officers as
last extended by Tamil Nadu Act 27 of 1991 is due to expire at noon on the

District Municipalities (Second Amendment and Special Provisions) Act, 1990
(Tamil Nadu Act 33 of 1990) a Special Officer has been appointed to Ambattur
Municipal Council, (which was Municipal Township and constituted as a

May 1981, respectively. The term of office of these Special Officers as last
extended by Tamil Nadu Act 21 of 1991 is due to expire on the 31st day of
March 1992.3\. Though the Government decided to conduct elections to all the
99 Municipalities and to the Municipal Corporations of Madras, Madurai and
Coimbatore on the 30th August 1991, these elections could not be conducted due
to the serious turn taken in the dispute regarding the sharing of Cauvery

Act 25 of 1981), there is a general provision enabling the State Government to
appoint any officer to assist the Commissioner and also empowering the
Commissioner to delegate any of his powers, duties and functions to the holder

of 1994). - Many representations were received from the management of private
schools and colleges in corporation and municipal areas, to exempt them, from
the payment of property tax. Their main contentions are that the institutions
are being run on non-commercial basis and that they are maintained only
through the fees collected from the students. The Government after careful
consideration of the said representations, have decided to exempt the
educational institutions from the payment of property tax. It has also been
decided that such exemption should be with effect from the 18th day of October
1990, in respect of municipalities and with effect from the 1st day of April
1994, in respect of Municipal Corporations. To give effect to the above
decisions, it is proposed to amend the Acts relating to the Municipal

the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, provisions have been
made in the local authorities Acts for reservation of Scheduled Castes and

Classes in this State also. Recently, several Members of the Legislative
Assembly also requested to make reservation of seats in the local bodies for
Backward Classes including most Backward Classes in addition to reservation
for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and for women. Accordingly, the
Government have now decided to reserve fifty per cent of the Wards and
Chairpersons of town Panchayats, municipalities and corporations to tire
persons belonging to Backward Classes of citizens including Most Backward
Classes. Out of the total number of seats reserved for them, one third will be
reserved for women belonging to Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes.2\.

Government have decided to conduct elections to all the Village Panchayats,
Panchayat Union Councils and District Panchayats in December 1995 and to
conduct the elections to Town Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal

of Writ Petitions have been filed in High Court, Madras against the
reservation of fifty per cent of wards at each level and of the offices of
presidents of village Panchayat, chairmen of Panchayat union councils and
chairmen of district Panchayats to the persons belonging to the backward
Classes of citizens. The Writ petitions have not yet been disposed of by the
High Court, Madras. Therefore, the State Election Commission can conduct
Panchayat elections only after the disposal of Writ Petitions pending in the
High Court and the elections to the town Panchayats, municipalities and
municipal corporations thereafter. Since the present term of office of the
Special Officers of all Town Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal
Corporations is due to expire on the 31st December 1995 and it is not possible
to conduct elections to these local bodies before the 31st December 1995, it
has become necessary to extend the term of office of those Special Officers
further. The Government have, therefore, decided to extend the term of office
of the Special Officers of all Town Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal
Corporations for a further period of six months beyond the 31st day of
December 1995 and to amend the relevant Acts suitably for the said purpose.3\.

Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 28th
December 1995.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws
(Second Amendment) Act, 1995 (Tamil Nadu Act 46 of 1995). - The Government
decided to conduct elections to all the village Panchayats, Panchayat union
councils and district Panchayats in December 1995 and to conduct the elections
to Town Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal Corporations thereafter.
Accordingly, the State Election Commission was making all arrangements to
conduct the Panchayat elections. In the meantime, a batch of writ petitions
were filed in High Court, Madras against the reservation of fifty per cent of
wards at each level and of the offices of presidents of village Panchayat
union councils and chairmen of district Panchayats to the persons belonging to
the Backward Classes of citizens.2\. The High Court, Madras, in its Judgment
dated the 3rd April 1996, in W. P. Nos. 14637/95, etc., has struck down the
provisions the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994 as amended by the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats (Second Amendment) Act, 1995 providing reservation for Backward
Classes of citizens and all notifications issued under the said Act effecting
reservation in favour of Backward Classes of citizens.For the same reasons the
provisions made in the Laws relating to Municipalities and Municipal
Corporations providing for reservation of seats and offices of chair-persons
for Backward Classes of citizens in the Town Panchayats, Municipalities and
Municipal Corporations are likely to be struck down, if challenged before the
Courts as in the case of reservations made to Panchayats. Therefore, the
Government have decided to conduct elections to all local bodies for the time
being without reservation in favour of Backward Classes of citizens.3\. In
order to complete the process of elections to all Town Panchayats,
Municipalities and Municipal Corporations in the State, at an early date it is
necessary to omit the provisions relating to the reservation for Backward
Classes of citizens made in the laws relating to Municipalities and Municipal
Corporations and accordingly the Government have decided to amend the
Municipal Laws suitably.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 31st May, 1996.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Third Amendment) Act, 1996 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1996). - A comprehensive Act applicable to all the Town Panchayats,
Municipalities and Corporations in the State is under preparation of the
Government. It will take sometime to finalise the comprehensive Bill. In the
meantime, the Government have decided to conduct elections to the Urban Local
Bodies during September 1996. It, therefore, becomes necessary to amend the
existing Municipal and Corporation Acts pertaining to conduct of elections and
other related issues without waiting for the enactment of the Comprehensive
Act. The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the existing Municipal
and Corporation Acts on the following points:-(i) There are provisions for
constitution of six Standing Committees in the Corporations to assist the
Corporation Councils on matters relating to Accounts, Education, Health,
Taxation and Finance, Town Planning and Improvements and Municipal Works.
Recently, provisions have been made for formation of Ward offices and ward
committees in Municipalities and Corporations having population of more than
3.00 lakhs to look after the civil amenities in their areas. Therefore,
instead of mentioning the names of the Standing Committees in the Acts, it has
been decided to make provisions in the Acts to the effect that the Government
may by notification constitute Standing Committees not exceeding three in
number.(ii) Now, there are provisions in the Corporation Acts that the Speaker
of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly shall nominate one fifth of the M.L.
As. of a City by rotation to be members of the Corporation Council. With a
view to enable all the M.L.As. in a city to participate in the meetings of a
Corporation Council, it has been decided that all the members of the State
Legislate Assembly representing the constituency comprising the whole or any
part of the Corporation shall be the members of the Corporation Councils. It
has also been decided that the members of the House of People and the members
of the Legislative Assembly so nominated shall be members of the respective
Municipal and Corporation Councils without any voting rights in the
proceedings of the councils.(iii) There are provisions in the Madras, Madurai
and Coimbatore Corporation Acts for formation of Ward Committees and the
members of such committees to be formed have also been mentioned in the Acts
itself. Further, powers and functions of the Ward Committees have also been
prescribed in the Acts itself. Since the number of ward offices to be formed
in the Corporations may vary, from time to time, it has been decided to delete
these provisions and to empower, the Government to, notify the number of ward
offices to be formed in a Corporation and to fix guidelines regarding the
duties and functions of such Ward Committees. Further, it has also been
decided to prescribe the term of chairman of such Ward Committees as five
years similar to the term of Chairman and Mayors of Municipalities and
Corporations.(iv) In the 74th Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1992, eighteen
subjects have been listed out in the Twelfth Schedule to the Act which can be
entrusted to the municipalities and corporations by the State Government
subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be specified. But, when the
municipal and corporation Acts were amended during May 1994, the following
three subjects were not included in the Schedules of the Municipal Corporation
Acts:-(a) Urban Planning including Town Planning.(b) Regulation of land use
and constructions of buildings.(c) Fire Services.Now, it has been decided to
incorporate these subjects also in the Municipal and Corporation Acts.(v) The
Offices of Chairpersons of Town Panchayats and Municipalities shall be
reserved for Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes in proportion to the
percentage of SC/ST. population in the Town Panchayats and Municipalities and
not less than one-third of the total offices of chairpersons shall be reserved
for women. But, in the Corporation Act, there are now specific provisions that
one office of the Mayor shall be reserved for S.C./S.T. and two offices of
Mayors shall be reserved for women. With a view to have uniform policy in
reservation, it has been decided that the Corporation Act may be amended
similar to the provisions in the Municipal Act. Further since there are only
six Corporations in the State, it has also been decided that where no office
of Mayor can be reserved for S.C./S.T. one office of Mayor of a corporation
having the highest percentage of population of S.C./S.T. shall be reserved for
women belonging to S.C./S.T. out of the total number of offices of Mayors
reserved for women.(vi) In view of the direct elections to Chairman and Mayors
of the Municipal and Corporations, the State Election Commission has now
suggested a few amendments to the existing sections of the Municipal and
Corporation Acts. Accordingly, it has also been decided to amend the Municipal
and Corporation Acts suitably.The Government have therefore now decided to
amend the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of
1920), the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of
1919), the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of
1971), the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25
of 1981), the Tamil Nadu Municipal Corporation Laws (Amendment and Special
Provisions) Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 26 of 1994), the Tiruchirappalli City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 27 of 1994), the Tirunelveli
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1994), and the
Salem City Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 29 of 1994).3\. The

existing provisions of the Municipal and Corporation Acts, the Government will
have to provide the deposit amount to be made by candidates contesting the
elections to the urban local bodies in the Tamil Nadu Town Panchayats.
Municipalities and Municipal Corporations Election Rules, 1996. But there is a
proviso in these Acts that the deposit amount required shall not exceed one
hundred rupees. The maximum amount of deposit provided in the Municipal and
Corporation Acts is very megre and has not been revised so far. Therefore, the
Government have now decided to fix the maximum amount of deposit as three
thousand rupees in the case of Municipalities and Town Panchayats and six
thousand rupees in the case of Municipal Corporations. Accordingly, it is
proposed to amend the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920, the Madras
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919, the Madurai City Municipal Corporation
Act, 1971 and the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 suitably for
the above purpose so as to enable the Government, to prescribe in the Election
Rules the actual amount of deposits within the maximum amount now to be

The area comprising the City of Madras has been called as "Chennai" in Tamil
from ancient days. This name has been employed by the people in different
walks of life and it has thus been universally accepted. Keeping the universal
acceptance of the name "Chennai" in view and keeping also the historical,
social, cultural and other details of the City of Madras in view, the
Government have taken a policy decision that Madras would be hereafter called
"Chennai" in all languages, as against "Madras" and "Madharas" now being
called in other languages.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decision.Published in Part IV-Section I of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 31st August 2 996.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1997 (Tamil Nadu Act 65 of
1997). - In the Municipalities and Municipal Corporations, the property tax is
levied based on the actual value which is generally being calculated on the
basis of reasonable letting value of the buildings. A percentage of the annual
value as fixed by the council within the maximum percentage prescribed in the
respective Urban Local Bodies Acts is levied as property tax. This system of
levying the property tax leads to arbitrary assessments and malpractices.
Therefore, the Government have examined the whole issue, and have evolved a
new and scientific method of assessment of tax and have decided to levy the
property tax in all the Urban Local Bodies as indicated below:-(1) A basic tax
rate would be arrived at for a class of buildings depending upon the existing
property tax and the use of the building. Based on this, the tax for the total
carpet area of that building will be worked out.(2) Additional basic tax will
be added to the basic tax, depending upon the location and the type of
construction of the building.(3) An amount would be reduced from the basic tax
depending on age of the building.(4) The resulting amount will be the property
tax for a half year.2\. This new system of levying the property tax has been
incorporated in the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies Bill, 1997, (L.A. Bill No.
42 of 1997) which has been referred to the Select Committee and it is now
under the consideration of the Select Committee. It is likely that it will
take some more time to get the said Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies Bill enacted
and to frame the rules thereunder.3\. The next general revision of the
property tax in all the municipalities in-the State is due on the 1st October
1998. The-Property Tax in the municipal corporations of Chennai, Madurai and
Coimbatore was last revised on the 1st April 1993 and that in the then
municipalities of Salem, Tiruchirapalli and Tirunelveli on the 1st October
1993. The Town Panchayats in the State which were brought under the Tamil Nadu
District Municipalities Act in the year 1994, have to start levying the
property tax as per the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920 instead
of the house tax they had levied, previously. The property tax being one of
the main sources of income for the Urban Local Bodies, there is urgent need to
initiate timely action on the revision of property tax having regard to the
rising cost of urban services, and also the property values. It is, therefore,
considered necessary to undertake the general revision of property tax in all
the Urban Local Bodies, from the dates to be notified by the Government.4\.
The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the Chennai City Municipal
Corporation Act 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the Tamil Nadu District
Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920), the Madurai City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971) and the Coimbatore
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981) suitably. The
said Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981 is applicable to Tiruchirapalli, Tirunelveli
and Salem Municipal Corporations.5\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the
above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated 17th October 1997.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 1997 (Tamil Nadu Act 3 of
1997). - While the terms of office of Chairmen and Vice-chairmen of all Town
Panchayats and Municipalities and that of Mayors of Corporations were five
years, the term of Deputy Mayors of Corporations alone was one year. With a
view to have uniformity in the term of office of Mayors, Deputy Mayors,
Chairmen and Vice-chairmen in all the Urban Local Bodies in the State, the
Government decided to make the term of Deputy Mayors of all Corporations in
the State also as five years.2\. Further, the Government have to nominate
members to each urban local body in addition to the councillors elected by the
public. The Government decided not to nominate any member as that would have
increased the strength of the councils and made it unnecessarily large.3\. The
term of office of Special Officers of Courtallam and Bhavanisagar
Municipalities and Yercaud Town Panchayat for which elections were not
conducted so far was to expire on the 31st December 1996. A proposal to re-
constitute the local bodies as Town Panchayat and Panchayat Union,
respectively is under consideration of Government. Since pending a decision on
this proposal, it is not possible to conduct elections to these local bodies
before the 31st December 1996 and therefore the Government decided to extend
the term of office of Special Officers of these local bodies for a further
period of six months from the 31st December 1996.4\. The Chief Minister in a
conference of all the Chairmen and Mayors of Urban Local Bodies in the State
held at Chennai on the 30th November and 1st December 1996 announced the
acceptance of some of the recommendations made by the work groups of
chairpersons. He also announced that in pursuance of this, certain amendments
to the Local Body Acts would be made by the promulgation of an Ordinance.
Accordingly, the Government decided to amend the Acts governing the
Corporations and Municipalities for the following purposes, namely:-(1)
Constitution of an Appointments Committee in the Corporation of Chennai;(2)
increasing the number of Standing Committees from three to six in all
Corporations;(3) empowering the Government to entrust additional functions
under the Corporations Acts to the Mayors;(4) empowering the Government to fix
monetary limits for authorities of the Corporations for execution of works;(5)
empowering the municipal councils to elect four councillors as members of the
Taxations Appeals Committee in the Municipalities; and(6) increasing the
period of three years for assessing the escaped assessment of property tax to
six years.5\. To give effect to the above said decisions, three Ordinances,
namely, the Tamil Nadu Municipal Corporation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 1996
(Tamil Nadu Ordinance 5 of 1996), the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Fifth
Amendment) Ordinance, 1996 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 8 of 1996) and the Tamil Nadu
Municipal Laws (Sixth Amendment) Ordinance 1996 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 12 of
1996) have been promulgated by the Governor on the 18th October 1996,14th
November 1996 and 27th December, 1996, respectively to amend the Tamil Nadu
District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920), the Chennai City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the Madurai City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971), the Coimbatore
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981), the
Tiruchirapalli City Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 27 of
1994), the Tirunelveli City Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 28
of 1994) and the Salem City Municipal Corporations Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act
29 of 1994), suitably.6\. This Bill seeks to replace the above said
Ordinances.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 29th January 1997.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 51 of 1998). -
A large number of hoardings have been erected on the road sides and over the
buildings in the City of Chennai and in other urban areas of the State without
proper licence. This had led to serious inconvenience to pedestrians, traffic
hazards, accidents and creating an in-safe environment to the general public.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to regulate the erection of hoardings.2\. The
Government decided to make provisions in the urban local bodies Acts to
regulate the erection of hoardings in the urban local areas by issue of
licences and for removing the advertisements which do not comply with the
regulations. As per the new provisions, the Commissioners and executive
officers of all urban local bodies will have the power to issue licences for
the erection of hoardings in the area comprising the jurisdiction of that
local body. The Government also decided to levy tax on advertisements in the
municipal areas by amending the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920
(Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920) on the lines of the Municipal Corporations Acts.
Accordingly, the Government decided to amend the Chennai City Municipal
Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the Tamil Nadu District
Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920), the Madurai City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971) and the Coimbatore
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981) suitably for
the said purposes. The amendments made in the Coimbatore City Municipal
Corporation Act, 1981 are applicable to the newly created Corporations of
Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli and Salem also. To give effect to the above
decisions, the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998 (Tamil
Nadu Ordinance 2 of 1998) was promulgated by the Governor on the 23rd July
1998, and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 23rd July 1998.3\. The Government in the year 1985
decided to acquire the hoardings and to lease them to private individuals with
a view to control the haphazard growth of hoardings in the urban local bodies.
Accordingly, the Government enacted the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Hoardings
Act, 1985 (Tamil Nadu Act 39 of 1985) and the same was made applicable in the
first instance to the City of Chennai only. However, a batch of writ petitions
were filed in the High Court challenging the Act. The High Court upheld the
provisions of the Act to acquire the hoardings in public places and suggested
to make provisions to regulate the hoardings erected in private places.
Against this, a few advertisers filed Special Leave Petitions in the Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court while admitting Special Leave Petitions ordered on
the 6th September 1996, status quo regarding the renewed leases. Inasmuch as
the Government have taken a decision to regulate the hoardings, whether in
public or private places in the urban local bodies, the said Tamil Nadu
Ordinance 2 of 1998 was promulgated for the purpose. In view of this, it has
now been decided to repeal the said Tamil Nadu Act 39 of 1985 by incorporating
suitable provision in the proposed legislation.4\. The Bill seeks to replace
the said Ordinance and to give effect to the above decision.Published in Part
IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the
24th November, 1998.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Municipal
Laws (Second Amendment) Amendment Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 34 of 1998). - The
Municipal Laws relating to Municipalities and Municipal Corporations have been
amended by the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1997 (Tamil
Nadu Act 65 of 1997) for the levy of property tax by adopting a new and
scientific method of assessment of tax. While discussing with the
representatives of urban local bodies and the Heads of Departments' regarding
levy of property tax under the new system, it has been, suggested that the
following further amendments have to be made in the Municipal and Corporation
Acts, namely:-(1) As per the existing provision, the buildings constructed in
contravention of the building rules will not be assessed to property tax,
which will result a huge loss of revenue to the urban local bodies. Therefore,
it has been decided to delete the said provision.(2) It has been decided to
empower the councils of urban local bodies to exempt from levy of property tax
any building having carpet area not exceeding one hundred square feet,
constructed with mud walls and thatched roof subject to such rules as may be
made by the Government.(3) It has been also decided to make provision to the
effect that the person preferring appeal against the orders of Taxation
Appeals Tribunal or the Taxation Appeals Committee, as the case may be, shall
continue to deposit the property tax with the local body as decided by the
said Tribunal or the Committee, as the case may be, till the disposal of the
appeal by the District Judge in order to reduce the arrears in property
tax.2\. Further it has also been decided to make provisions for the following
purposes, namely:-(a) where there is-any land with building and if the extent
of the land left vacant twice the plinth area of the building, the property
tax shall be levied, on the vacant land which exceeds twice the plinth area of
the building at the rate fixed by the Council and no property tax on any land
shall be levied if the extent of such land with or without any building
thereon, does not exceed two thousand and four hundred square feet;(b) to
impose penalty for non-filing of self-assessment return by the owner or
occupier of the building or land;(c) to levy education tax under the municipal
laws instead of levying such tax under the Tamil Nadu Elementary Education
Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act VIII of 1920).(3) Inasmuch as the said Tamil Nadu
Act 65 of 1997 has not yet been brought into force it has been decided to
amend the said Act suitably for the above purposes.4\. The Bill seeks to give
effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 28th May 1998.Statement of Objects
and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1998 (Tamil
Nadu Act 51 of 1998). - At present, the profession tax in all the urban local
bodies is being collected under the provisions contained in a special Act
called "The Tamil Nadu Tax on Professions, Trades, Callings and Employments
Act, 1992". As the traders had expressed certain reservation to some
provisions of the said Act, the Government constituted a Committee to review
the said Act The Committee submitted its report to the Government on 2nd
September, 1998. The Committee has, in its report, made the following major
recommendations:-(1) The existing Special Act (1992) may be repealed and
suitable provisions for collection of profession tax may be incorporated in
the Municipal and Corporation Acts.(2) Profession Tax may be collected from
the salaried people as well as from traders and other professionals on the
basis of income.(3) There would be no profession tax leviable from individuals
whose income falls below Rs. 15,000 per half-year. The Government have decided
to raise this exemption limit to Rs. 21,000 per half-year.(4) The local bodies
themselves shall increase the rate of profession tax once in five years within
a minimum of 25 per cent and a maximum of 35 per cent.(5) The profession tax
shall be paid for every half-year. If the profession tax is not paid within
that half-year period, a penalty shall be collected at the rate of 2 per cent
for every month. But, the Government have decided to collect penalty at the
rate of 1 per cent for every month.(6) The traders and professionals other
than the salaried people shall file a self assessment return in the form
prescribed to the urban local body along with paying the first half-year tax,
if it is found later that the particulars furnished by them are incorrect 100
per cent of the difference in tax shall be levied as penalty.(7) Many of the
traders and other professionals have not paid the tax so far from the year
1992, i.e., the year from which the existing Act came into force. Therefore,
they may be permitted to remit the tax by filing a "Return" as prescribed in
the new system. But they should furnish the details of the amount due by them
to the urban local body in a return before 31st December, 1998. Then they may
be permitted to pay the due as per the rates prescribed in the existing Act
for a half year along with the current half-year.(8) These recommendations
maybe given effect from the 1st October, 1998.2\. The Government after
examining the report of the Committee have decided to accept the
recommendations of the Committee and to amend the Municipal and Corporations
Act suitably. Accordingly, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919
(Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act 1920
(Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920), the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1917
(Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971), and the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation
Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981) have been amended for this purpose. The
amendments incorporated in the. Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act,
1981, will apply mutatis mutandis to the newly created Tiruchirappalli,
Tirunelveli and Salem Corporations.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
said objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated 27tli November 1998.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies (Amendment) Act, 1999 (Tamil Nadu Act
54 of 1999). - A simplified procedure for the levy and collection of
profession tax with effect from the 1st October 1998 was introduced in the
Acts applicable to the corporations, municipalities and town panchayats by the
Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 59 of
1998). As the existing Acts applicable to the said corporations,
municipalities and town Panchayats will stand repealed when the Tamil Nadu
Urban Local Bodies Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 1999) is brought into force,
it has been decided to incorporate the said provisions in the said Tamil Nadu
Act 9 of 1999.2\. The Tamil Nadu State Election Commission has, among other
things, suggested to make the intention clear that the expression "While
undergoing the sentence" occurring in sub-section (4) of section 12 of the Act
may be substituted by the expression "While the sentence is in force", based
on the observation of the High Court Chennai in an election petition. Further,
it has been proposed to avail the opportunity to make certain modifications
and improvements in the said Act.3\. The Government have therefore decided to
amend the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 1999)
suitably.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in
Part IV-Section I of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated
the 19th November, 1999.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu
Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2000 (Tamil Nadu Act 26 of 2000). - In the
year 1998, the Government repealed the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Hoardings
Act, 1985 which provided for acquisition of hoardings by the Government in the
urban local bodies, and made provisions in the existing Municipal and
Corporation Acts to regulate the erection of such hoardings by issue of
licence in accordance with the rules issued by the Government. This Act
incidentally also became a compliance to High Court direction while disposing
of a batch of writ petitions directing the Government to come out with a
scheme to regulate such hoardings. However, against this new legislation,
certain persons filed writ petitions in the High Court of Chennai and obtained
stay for the provision relating to issue of licence by urban local bodies.
This case is still pending disposal by the High Court.2\. While the State has
thus not been able to successfully implement any scheme for regulating the
hoardings, the Supreme Court, New Delhi has delivered a judgment in the year
1998 directing the authorities to remove all hoardings in Delhi which are on
road sides and therefore are hazardous and disturbance to safe traffic
movement. The Government examined the whole case of regulating hoardings in
the light of this judgment of the Supreme Court and have now decided to amend
the Urban Local Bodies Acts in conformity with the judgment of the Supreme
Court.3\. Accordingly, the Government have decided to amend the Chennai City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the Tamil Nadu
District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920), the Madurai City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu 15 of 1971), the Coimbatore City
Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1981) and the Tamil Nadu
Urban Local Bodies Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 1999) for the purpose to
make a provision for removal of the hoardings erected within municipal limits
on public or private or municipal or Government lands which are visible to the
traffic on the road irrespective of whether they are on the road side or
not.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in Part

Nadu Urban Local Bodies Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 1999) and the rules
made thereunder were brought into force with effect from the 1st August 2000.
However, representation have been received from certain local bodies
requesting time to study the Act and Rules before their actual implementation.
In order to allow time for the local bodies to study the provisions of the Act
and Rules and to suggest changes, if necessary, and to dispel the doubts that
linger on, the Government have decided to suspend the operation of the said
Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies Act, 1998 and the rules made thereunder and to
revive the operation of enactments and the rules, etc., repealed by the said
Act, so as to enable the local bodies to carry out all the activities under
the provisions of the revived enactments and the rules, etc., and to function
as before that is to say, prior to the 1st August 2000. To give effect to the
above decision, the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies (Suspension of Operation)

have now reviewed the said amendments and have decided to restore certain
provisions, as it stood prior to the amendments made by the said Tamil Nadu
Act 3 of 1997, with enhanced financial powers to such authorities. Further, as
the Mayor is not a Municipal authority, the Government have decided to
substitute sections 37 and 37-A of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act,

Member of the Legislative Assembly of the State and Member of Parliament to
contest for election of Chairman and Deputy Chairman in the local bodies. The
Tamil Nadu State Election Commission has forwarded the above representations

offices are seeking the permission of the Government before they leave for
abroad. It has been considered necessary to make a specific provision in the
Acts concerned providing for the above purpose and the penalty for violation
of such provision.2\. The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the
Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the

fine not exceeding one thousand rupees for undertaking a trip to any foreign
country by the elected representatives of the Municipal Corporations and
Municipalities in their official capacity without the permission of the
Government is too low. The Government have, therefore, decided to enhance the
said penalty to fifty thousand rupees and also to make a provision enabling

lakhs and for the Taxation and Finance Committee, the powers are up to Rs. 20
lakhs. All works up to the above value have to be approved by the respective
Standing Committee and that the Standing Committees meet only once in a month
and the procedure of requiring files to go through the Standing Committees for
approval of such estimates involves delay.2\. In order to speed up the
execution of development works for the benefit of the public, the Government
have decided to revise the financial powers of the Commissioner of Chennai
Corporation from Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 35 lakhs. Consequently, it has also been
decided to raise the financial powers of the Standing Committees, other than
the Taxation and Finance Committee and the Standing Committee (Taxation and
Finance) to Rs. 40 lakhs and Rs. 45 lakhs, respectively. The Government have
decided to retain the financial powers of the Council at Rs. 50 lakhs.
Accordingly, the Government have decided to amend the Chennai City Municipal
Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919) suitably, for the above
purpose. Accordingly, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation (Amendment)
Ordinance, 2003 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 9 of 2003) was promulgated by the
Governor on the 29th October 2003 and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 30th October 2003.3\. The Bill
seeks to replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the
Tamil Nadu Govt. Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 6.11.2003.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Chennai City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2005
(Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 2005). - Consequent on the revision of powers of the
Standing Committees and the Commissioner of the Corporation of Chennai under
the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919},
as amended by Tamil Nadu Act 41 of 2003, the need for holding monthly meeting
of the Chennai Corporation Council for according clearance for various tenders
and other important issues have come down. The Standing Committees, which meet
every month, accord its approval for most of the important issues. Hence, the
Government felt that it will be sufficient if the Council meetings are
convened at least once in every three months so that the officers of the
Corporation of Chennai will spend more time in field than being done now.2\.
The Government have, therefore, decided to amend rules 2 and 4 under the
Schedule II to the said Act so as to conduct the meeting of the Council at
least once in every three months and also to place the statement of receipts
and disbursements on account of the municipal fund before the council once in
every three months, respectively. The Government have also decided to amend
clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 53 of the said Act so as to provide
for disqualification of a councillor if he fails to attend the meetings of the
council for three consecutive ordinary meetings of the council.3\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of
the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 21th April
2005.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment)
Act, 2006 (Tamil Nadu Act 18 of 2006). - At present election to the
municipalities and municipal corporations are conducted on party basis. It has
been brought to the notice of the Government that the councils of certain
municipalities and municipal corporations are not functioning properly since
the chairman or, as the case may be, the mayor belongs to one party and
majority of councillors belong to a different party. It is considered that if
the mayor of a corporation or the chairman of a municipality enjoys the
support of majority of councillors, the council can function in a better
manner. Therefore, the Government decided to elect the mayors of the
corporations and chairman of the municipalities including, Third Grade
Municipalities and town Panchayats indirectly by councillors or members, as
the case may be, from among themselves.2\. The next ordinary elections to the
municipal corporations, municipalities including Third Grade Municipalities
and town Panchayats have to be conducted before the 24th October 2006 as the
present term of the councils of the said municipal corporations and
municipalities are due to expire on 24th October 2006. The ward-wise 2001
census figures were received recently. If fresh delimitation of division or
wards arc taken up based on the 2001 census figures, the ordinary election to
the said municipal corporations and municipalities cannot be conducted before
the 24lh October 2006. It is considered that it would be proper to take up
delimitation of divisions or wards of the municipal corporations and
municipalities after the delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly
Constituencies. The Government, therefore, decided to conduct the ordinary
elections to all the municipal corporations and municipalities including third
grade municipalities and town Panchayats to be held before the 24th October
2006, based on the existing territorial area of the divisions or wards, total
number of wards and total number of councillors or members to be returned from
such divisions or wards.3\. The Government have also decided that the special
village Panchayats constituted under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994
(Tamil Nadu Act 21 of 1994) be constituted as town Panchayats under the Tamil
Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920).4\. To give
effect to the above decisions, the Government decided to amend the laws
relating to the municipal corporations and municipalities, suitably.5\.
Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2006 (Tamil
Nadu Ordinance 4 of 2006) was promulgated by the Governor on the 14th July
2006 and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 14th July 200o.6\. The Bill seeks to replace the said
Ordinance.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 22nd August 2006.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Chennai City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2007 (Tamil Nadu Act 1 of
2007). - In order to conduct meetings of the Council of the Corporation of
Chennai at least once in every three months, instead of every month and to
provide for consequential amendments for placing of accounts at the meeting
and for disqualification of councillors for failure to attend three
consecutive meetings, rules 2 and 4 of the Rules regarding proceeding of the
Council and Committees contained in Schedule II to the Chennai City Municipal
Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919) and clause (i) of sub-
section (1) of section 53 of the said Act were amended by the Chennai City
Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2005 (Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 2005).2\. The
Government on re-examination, now consider that the earlier provision
mandating the conducting of the Council meeting at least once in a month
should be restored, as it enables the Council to address the problems and
grievances of the public then and there. The Government, therefore, have
decided to amend rules 2 and 4 of the said Rules contained in Schedule II to
the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919)
and clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 53 of the said Act, so as to
restore the position as it stood prior to Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 2005.3\. In the
enactments relating to Municipal Corporations other than Chennai City
Municipal Corporation, the Mayer and Deputy Mayor are eligible for re-
election. The Government desires to have uniform pro visions as regards
eligibility of Mayor and Deputy Mayor for re-election in all the enactments
relating to Municipal Corporations. The Government have, therefore, decided to
amend the Chennai City Municipal. Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of
1919), suitably.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 22nd January 2007.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2007 (Tamil Nadu Act 37 of 2007). -
Of late, large number of no confidence motions are received against the
chairmen and vice-chairmen of municipalities and town Panchayats. Such large
number of no confidence motions are unprecedented in the long history of the
local bodies administration of this State. This may be due to better awareness
of the provisions of the statutes on this issue or may be due to the growing
intolerance among the elected representatives of the urban local bodies, out
of political or personal reasons. However, it may also be attributed to
unethical practices. This trend tends to divert the focus and attention of the
council and administration from the real issues concerning, the welfare of the
people such as basic civic needs, infrastructure facilities and other
development oriented initiatives and activities. As a result, smooth and
cordial atmosphere of the councils of the concerned urban local bodies is
disturbed and also the conduct of the meetings of the said councils is
affected. This also tends to affect the administration of the urban local
bodies. Though moving and passing of no-confidence motions are considered to
be democratic rights, frequent use and misuse of the same will affect the very
same democracy.2\. The Government have, therefore, decided to curb the above
undesirable trend and accordingly decided to make the provisions relating to
moving and passing of no-confidence motions more stringent by amending the
laws relating to the urban local bodies. The Government have also decided to
abate all motions made expressing want of confidence and pending before any
officer, authority, or the Government, immediately before the 4th October
2007. Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2007
(Tamil Nadu Ordinance 5 of 2007) was promulgated by the Governor on the 4th

Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 18th October 2007.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 2008 (Tamil Nadu
Act 35 of 2008). - At present there is no specific provision in the Acts
governing urban local bodies to grant paid holidays on the day of poll, to
those who are employed in any business, trade, industrial undertakings or
other establishments and are entitled to vote at election to such urban local
bodies. In view of that, during the urban local body elections, traders,
industrial undertakings and other establishments do not grant pa id holidays
to their employees on the day of poll. The Tamil Nadu State Election
Commission has requested the Government to make necessary provisions in the
Acts governing urban local bodies to grant a holiday on the day of poll.
Therefore, the Government have decided to make specific provision in the Acts
governing urban local bodies, casting a duty upon the business, trade,
industrial undertakings and other establishments to grant paid holiday on the
day of poll to their employee who are entitled to vote at election to such
urban local bodies and also to specify penalty for contravention thereof, on

inter alia stated that at present no legal measure can be taken, if the
property lax claim is more than six-years old. The said Commission has,
therefore, recommended that the time limit to initiate legal proceedings may

respect of any tax or other sum due as twelve years, by amending the Chennai
City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), the Madurai
