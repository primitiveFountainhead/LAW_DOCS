Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974(Tamil Nadu Act 13 of
1974)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation
Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974). - At present, two kinds of taxes are
being levied in this State on motor vehicles. Under the Tamil Nadu Motor
Vehicles Taxation Act, 1931 (Tamil Nadu Act III of 1931), tax is levied pm the
stage carriages, on the basis of seated and standing accommodation and
permitted daily mileage. In the case of goods vehicles, the tax is with
reference to the permitted laden weight. Besides the motor vehicle tax, a tax
on passengers and goods is levied under the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles
(Taxation of Passengers and Goods) Act, 1952 (Tamil Nadu Act XVI of 1952).
This levy is at the rate of 10 per cent of the collection of fares in the case
of stage carriages and 5 per cent of the collection of freight in the case of
public carriers. The question of consolidation and simplification of taxation
in respect of motor vehicles has been engaging the attention of the Government
for some time past. The Government have now decided that instead of two taxes,
namely, tax on passengers and goods and tax on motor vehicles, the tax
structure may be rationalised and revised and a single tax may be levied only
on motor vehicles, falling under Entry 57 of the State List in the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the
above decision. The provisions of the Bill are explained in the Notes on
Clauses appended to the Bill.Published in Part IV - Section 1, page 54 of the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 19th March
1974,Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation
(Second Amendment) Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1974). - According to
section 66 (3)(h) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of 1988),
permit is not required to the transport vehicle owned by and used solely for
the purpose of any educational institution recognised by Central or State
Government. The yearly tax under the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act,
1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974) for the vehicles belonging to such recognised
educational institutions is Rs. 1,500. In the case of vehicles belonging to
educational institutions other than those coming under section 66 (3)(h) of
the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a tax of Rs. 110 per quarter is levied under the
said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974. The Government have decided that a uniform
yearly tax of Rs. 2,000 may be levied on vehicles belonging to all educational
institutions.2\. Rig mounted vehicles were treated as goods carriages. The
Government of India have since reclassified them as non-transport vehicles.
The Government have, therefore, decided to incorporate a separate category for
purposes of taxation to cover the rig mounted vehicles and to subject them for
a lump sum tax of Rs. 2,500 per annum, irrespective of the laden weight.3\.
Further, with a view to augment the revenue of the State, the Government have
decided to increase the motor vehicles tax payable under the Tamil Nadu Motor
Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974) in respect of certain
categories of light motor vehicles, goods carriages, contract carriages, stage
carriages and tourist vehicles. Accordingly, it has been decided to amend the
said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974 suitably.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to
the above decisions.Published in Part IV - Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 4th May 1994.Statement of Objects
and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1989 (Tamil
Nadu Act 25 of 1989). - There has been a striking and sustained growth in two-
wheelers, like mopeds, scooters and motor cycles from year to year. This has
rendered the present system of collection of motor vehicles tax cumbersome
both to the tax payers and to the Government. With a view to eliminate the
inconvenience involved in paying the half-yearly tax, it is proposed to
introduce lump sum payment of motor vehicles tax for motorised two-wheelers
which can be paid at the time of purchase of such new vehicles.2\. With a view
to augment the revenue of the State, the Government have also decided to
increase the quarterly tax payable under the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles
Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974) in respect of cars, omni buses
and vans. Accordingly, it has been decided to amend the said Act.3\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV - Section 1
of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 11th May
1989.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation
(Amendment) Act, 1990 (Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1990). - In terms of the proviso
to section 8 of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu
Act 13 of 1974) in the case of a transport vehicle in respect of which
temporary permit is granted under the Motor Vehicles Act, and the vehicle is
newly registered in the second or third month of a quarter, the tax due under
the said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974 in respect of that vehicle is also required
to be paid on the date of commencement of the quarter. In certain cases, the
vehicle itself may be acquired only in the second or third month of the
quarter in which case it cannot be registered in he first month of the
quarter. Hence, the collection of tax, prior to the date of registration of
the vehicle may not be possible. The Government have, therefore, decided to
amend section 8 of the said Act so as to provide for the payment of tax under
the said Act on the date of commencement of the validity of the temporary
permit.2\. Accordingly to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of
1988), the two categories of goods vehicles, namely, goods vehicles used for
hire or reward and goods vehicles not used for hire or reward have been
clubbed together and reclassified on the basis of laden weight. To be in
consonance with the above reclassification, it has been decided to suitably
amend the said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974. Further, with a view to augment the
revenue of the State, the Government have decided to increase the motor
vehicles tax payable under the said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974 in respect of
goods carriages, omni buses, stage carriages and private service vehicles.
Accordingly, it has been decided to suitably amend the said Act.3\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV - Section 1
of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 8th May
1990.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation
(Amendment) Act, 1991 (Tamil Nadu Act 5 of 1991). - According to paragraph III
of class 2 of the First Schedule to the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation
Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974), reserve stage carriages or spare buses
are liable to pay tax at the rate of three-fourths of the maximum rate payable
per passenger for any of the regular stage carriages of the permit holder.2\.
There was a glaring difference in the rates of tax levied on contract
carriages and the spare buses of stage carriages which were issued with
permits under new section 88(8) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, even though
both vehicles were used for the same purpose. Therefore, it was decided to tax
such spare buses at the rate applicable to contract carriages for the duration
for which such permits were issued. Accordingly in G.O. Ms. No. 357, Home,
dated the 16th February 1990, orders were issued for the publication of a
notification to the effect that the tax payable in respect of spare buses or
reserve stage carriages issued with special permits under sub- section (8) of
section 88 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of 1988) and
permitted to ply solely as contract carriages (not being stage carriages
plying as contract carriages) and to carry more than five persons (other than
the driver) shall be levied at the rate specified in paragraph II of class 2
of the First Schedule to the said Act. It was also ordered that such tax shall
be levied for the period for which such special permits are issued to such
spare buses, or reserve stage carriages and the tax or the differences of tax,
as the case may be, shall be collected. The said notification has come into
force with effect from the 16th February 1990.4\. It has been brought to the
notice of the Government that the burden of tax will be unbearable and will
force the stage carriage operators holding reserve stage carriage permits to
part with them since such operators, will not be able to maintain the said
carriages without operating them on special permits now and then. The
Government have, therefore, decided to collect the rate of tax in respect of
the spare buses or reserve stage carriages issued with special permits under
section 88(8) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 at the maximum rate of tax
payable per passenger per quarter for any of the regular stage carriage of the
permit holder, with effect on and from the 1st April 1990.5\. Accordingly, the
Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 1990 (Tamil
Nadu Ordinance 8 of 1990), was promulgated by the Governor.6\. The Bill seeks
to replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part IV - Section 1 of the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 23 January 1991.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation (Second Amendment)
Act, 1991 (Tamil Nadu Act 33 of 1991). - In tune with the policy of the
Government to reduce the burden of taxation on the common man, it is proposed
to exempt from motor vehicles tax, motor cycles of capacity of 50 cc. and
below which are, the most widely used vehicles for personal transportation.
Taking note of the concession extended to the common man, it is proposed to
share the burden of loss of revenue with those who own vehicles of higher
capacity. Further, with a view to augment the revenue of the State, the
Government have decided to increase the motor vehicles tax payable under the
Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974), in
respect of certain classes of vehicles like goods carriages, stage carriages
and other vehicles with effect from the 1st day of October 1991 and to amend
the said Act suitably.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decisions.Published in Part IV - Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 30th September 1991.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1992 (Tamil Nadu
Act 34 of 1992). - As the Central Government have modified the excise duty
based on a classification of capacity of motor cycles, it is proposed to
further rationalise the slabs of motor cycles in the State based on their
capacity. It is also proposed to revise the life time tax on motor cycles,
both new as well as old. It is also proposed to make further modification in
the annual tax payable by owners of motor vehicles with weight less than 700
kgs. unladen. The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the Tamil Nadu
Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974) for the
purpose.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in
Part IV - Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated
the 24th April 1992.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor
Vehicles Taxation (Second Amendment) Act, 1992 (Tamil Nadu Act 35 of 1992). -
Under section 8 of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil
Nadu Act 13 of 1974), the tax due under the Act has to be paid within thirty
days from the commencement of the quarter, half-year or year as may be
prescribed. Consequent on the representations received from the operators of
stage carriages, it has been decided to increase this period of thirty days to
forty-five days.2\. According to section-A of the said Act, no application for
the grant or renewal of fitness certificate in respect of a transport vehicle
under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of 1988), shall be
entertained, unless the tax due under the said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974 in
respect of such vehicle has been paid. In pursuance of the above provision,
new transport vehicles, produced for registration will have to be denied
fitness certificate unless the tax has been paid in respect of such vehicles.
On the representations received from certain State Transport Undertakings, it
has now been decided to make provisions in the said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974
to the effect that the above provision shall not apply for the issue of
fitness certificate in respect of such new transport vehicles.3\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV - Section 1
of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 24th April
1992.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation
(Third Amendment) Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 54 of 1994). - At present, the
Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974) does
not provide for the adjustment of the excess amount of tax paid in respect of
a motor vehicle against the tax payable for such vehicle under the said Act.
The Government have, therefore, decided to make a specific provision in this
regard by amending the said Act suitably.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to

Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1990 (Tamil
Nadu Act 13 of 1990), the tax under the said Act should be paid into the

the goods carriages not exceeding 3,000 Kgs. in weight laden, quarterly tax is
collected under the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu
Act 13 of 1974). The Regional Transport Officers are experiencing difficulties
in collecting the quarterly tax for such vehicles, since such vehicles tend to
move to other districts and are even sold to other persons in some other
districts without the permission of the Regional Transport Officer. The
officials concerned are unable to trace out those vehicles for which tax was
not paid, since permit for the aforesaid category of vehicles is not required
as per the provisions in clause (i) of subsection (3) of section 66 of the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of 1988).2\. To avoid tax evasion, it

old vehicle owners either to pay annual tax or life time tax dispensing with
the practice of payment of Quarterly/Half-yearly tax. Accordingly, the
Government have decided to amend the Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974, suitably.3\.

Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974),
inter alia, provides that any tax or penalty due under the said Act may be

Administration 2008-2009, it has been announced to enhance the rates of life
time tax to 8 per cent of the cost price of such vehicles with effect from
1-06-2008. The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the said Schedules
to the said Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974. It is also considered necessary to
provide a suitable provision enabling the persons to pay life time tax for the
remaining period of old vehicles registered and plying in this State, as a
consequential measure.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decision.Published in Part IV - Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 13th May 2008.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation (Amendment) Act, 2009 (Tamil Nadu Act 33 of
2009). - At present, as per class 2 (II) of the First Schedule to the Tamil
Nadu Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 1974), in respect
of Motor Vehicles plying solely as contract carriages and permitted to carry
more than five persons (other than the driver), a quarterly tax of Rs. 3,000
is being levied. As there is no provision in the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles
Rules, 1989 to fix the number of seats to be accommodated in a contract
carriage, the contract carriage operators, are fixing lesser number of seats
than the maximum number of seats possible and pay tax only for every person
which the vehicle is permitted to carry. This leads to loss of revenue. Hence,
in order to safeguard the tax revenue, the Government have decided to levy tax
on floor area basis in respect of contract carriages permitted to carry not
more than 35 persons and for other contract carriages on seat basis. The
Government have, therefore, decided to amend the said Act for the above
purpose.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in

specified in the direction of the Licensing Officer under section 15-A of the
said Act by the registered owner or the person having possession or control of
the motor vehicle while preferring an appeal. It is therefore, proposed to
amend the said Act suitably for payment of fifty per cent, of the tax directed
to be paid under section 15-A while preferring an appeal. Accordingly, the
Government have decided to amend the said Act for the purpose in view.2\. The

decided to levy life time tax for new vehicles of that kind, having a floor
area of more than 6 square meter and to levy quarterly tax based on the floor
area for already registered vehicles.Received the assent of the President on
