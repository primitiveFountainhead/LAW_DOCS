The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958(44 OF 1958)Statement of Objects and Reasons. -
Starting with the Bombay Coasting Vessels Act of 1838, a number of Acts
relating to merchant shipping were passed by the Indian Legislature from time
to time with the result that the law became increasingly difficult to be
referred to, and the need for consolidation became very pressing. Several
attempts were made to revise these laws in 1867, 1882 and again in 1893 and
1896, but all these attempts failed owing to legal and constitutional
difficulties. Two of the principal contributory factors were the then limited
powers of the Indian Legislature to legislate regarding shipping and the fact
that part of the British Statute law on the subject, including parts of the
Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which is the principal United Kingdom enactment
on the subject, applied to India and any Indian enactment had to be in legal
harmony with that law. A fresh attempt was made in 1921-22 to codify the
Indian law on merchant shipping by the Statute Law Revision Committee, which
decided that only consolidation, and not revision should be attempted
immediately. The result was the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923, which is
now on the Statute Book and which consolidated some 21 existing Indian Acts on
the subject. This Act has also been amended from time to time, the two major
amendments being those made in 1933 and in 1953 so as to take power to
implement the provisions of the international conventions with respect to load
lines, 1930, and with respect to safety of life at sea, 1948, respectively,
which have been ratified by India.2\. By reason of Article 372 of the
Constitution, the United Kingdom Acts still continue to be in force in India,
but the arrangement is unsatisfactory and the need for a comprehensive Indian
law on the subject has become urgent. One of the main deficiencies in the
Indian law is that there is no provision dealing with the registration of sea-
going ships except the Coasting Vessels Act, 1838, and the Indian Registration
of Ships Act, 1841, under which only sailing vessels are being registered; the
other ships being still registered under the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping
Act, 1894 and being technically regarded as British ships. Another defect in
the Indian law is that it has no extra territorial application as the British
Merchant Shipping Acts apply to Indian ships outside India. To meet the
immediate requirements of the country soon after independence the Merchant
Shipping Laws (Extension to Acceding States and Amendment) Act, 1949 was
enacted, by which the British Merchant Shipping Acts 1894 to 1938 were
extended to the Acceding States (later known as Part B States) and Indian
Consular Officers were empowered to perform functions in relation to Indian
ships outside India and provision was made to enable Government to prescribe
the proper national colours for ships registered in India. The Control of
Shipping Act, 1947, was another short-term measure which continued the war-
time control over Indian shipping and controlled the coastal trade by a system
of licensing. This Act, which has been renewed from time to time, is due to
expire on the 31st March, 1958.3\. The present Bill revises and consolidates
all laws in force in India relating to merchant shipping, whether passed by
the British Parliament or the Indian Legislature, and makes provision for the
matters discussed in the succeeding paragraphs, which also indicate the
principal changes made in the law.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment
Act 21 of 1966. - The minimum standards laid down in the Merchant Shipping
Act, 1958 which merchant ships should comply with in the interests of safety
of life and property a, sea are based on the International Convention for the
Safety of Life at Sea, 1948. The Fourth International Conference on Safety of
Life at Sea which met in London in May-June, 1960 under the aegis of the
Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, one of the specialised
agencies of the United Nations, reviewed the 1948 Convention in the light of
the experience of various countries during the intervening twelve years and
decided to replace it by a new Convention, namely, the International
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960. The new Convention was adopted
on the 17th June, 1960 and was, subject to acceptance, signed, among others,
by the representatives of the Government of India. As a prelude to depositing
our acceptance of the 1960 Convention, it is necessary to amend the Merchant
Shipping Act, 1958 suitably. As the Merchant Shipping Act already embodies the
requirements of the 1948 Convention, it is necessary to amend that Act only to
the extent that the 1960 Convention has deviated from the 1948 Convention.2\.
Some of the more important requirements of the 1960 Convention which involve
deviation from the provisions of the 1948 Convention and which therefore call
for amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 are summarised below:-(1)
Survey of cargo ships and issue of safety certificates to cargo ships. - Under
the 1960 Convention, the scope of survey of cargo ships has been extended to
cover the survey of hull, machinery and other equipment of cargo ships.
Further, all cargo ships of over 500 tons gross will be required to carry in
addition to the existing certificates a safety construction certificate issued
by or under the authority of a contracting Government. It is, therefore,
necessary to make suitable provisions in the Act for survey of cargo ships and
for the issue of safety construction certificates to cargo ships.(2) Stability
data. - In contrast to the 1948 Convention, the 1960 Convention requires that
every ship must carry on board sufficient data to enable the master, by rapid
and simple processes, to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of a
ship under varying conditions of service.(3) Life-saving appliances. - The
most important deviation made by the 1960 Convention in regard to life-saving
appliances relates to the removal of the restriction imposed by the 1948
Convention on the use of inflatable and other rafts which depend on air for
their buoyancy. Inflatable life-rafts as well as rigid life-rafts as an
alternative are now acceptable, provided these comply with certain
conditions.(4) Radio installation. - Under the 1948 Convention, cargo ships
below 500 tons gross were not required to be fitted with radio installations
but under the 1960 Convention even cargo ships of less than 500 but not less
than 300 tons gross are required to be fitted with such installations.(5)
Carriage of grain cargo. - The 1960 Convention contains a number of new
requirements relating to the carriage of grain in ships. Emphasis is laid on
the need for giving trimming and on the fundamental importance of preserving
the stability of the ship. Duly approved grain-loading plans are required to
be carried on board by ships carrying grain and such plans are required to be
accepted by the other contracting Governments as evidence of compliance with
the requirements of the Convention.(6) Carriage of dangerous goods. - The 1960
Convention contains a number of new regulations relating to the
classification, packing, labelling, documentation and stowage of dangerous
goods on board ships.(7) Nuclear ships. - The 1948 Convention does not contain
any special provisions relating to nuclear ships. Having regard to the new
problems in the field of safety owing to the advent of nuclear power as one of
the means of propulsion for merchant ships, and having regard to the hazards
inherent in the nuclear ships, it is necessary to have special provisions
relating to nuclear ships. The 1960 Convention contains a special Chapter for
this purpose. A number of requirements are provided for in this Chapter for
the purpose of ensuring that nuclear ships do not become a source of danger to
life, not only at sea but also at ports and other places and that such ships
do not become a source of contamination of food and water resources.Amendment
Act 25 of 1970-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - This Bill seeks to amend
the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, for the purpose of giving effect to three
International Conventions relating to Merchant Shipping, namely, the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil,
1954 (as amended in 1962), the International Convention on Limitation of
Liability of Owners of Sea-going Ships, 1957, and the International Convention
on Load Lines, 1966. The International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, has
already been ratified by the Government of India and has come into force on
the 21st July, 1968. The other two Conventions have yet to be ratified by the
Governmeni of India.2\. The concept of load lines has two facts. Firstly, it
provides for marking of free boards, i.e., the distance measured vertically
downward from the deck line which must at all times and under all conditions,
while the ship is afloat, remain free of water line. Secondly, it provides for
marking of load lines indicating how far the ship could be permitted to
submerge in water as a result of loading cargo in different seasons and
different zones. The need for controlling free boards in the interest of
safety of life at sea cannot be over-emphasised. The first international
agreement on the subject was reached at the International Conference on Load
Lines, 1930, and the existing provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act relating
to load lines are based upon the provisions of the Convention adopted by this
Conference. With a view to ensuring better safety of life and property on sea
and increasing freight earnings by shipping which has been made possible by
the improvements in the technique of ship-building and the progressive shift
of emphasis from smaller to larger ships, an agreement was reached at the
Second International Conference on Load Lines held in 1966 in London. The
International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, which seeks to replace the 1930
Convention on the subject is the outcome of this agreement. By and large the
1966 Convention tends to liberalise the free board requirements so as to
permit deeper loading of the ships as compared to the corresponding provisions
of the 1930 Convention. In particular, the 1966 Convention substantially
increases the period of tropical loading both in the Arabian Sea and the Bay
of Bengal thus permitting deeper loading of ships in this area during a
greater part of the year. The provisions of the Convention are, therefore, in
the larger interests of our expanding merchant shipping, as their freight
earnings will improve and this in turn would result in their earning more
foreign exchange. Clauses 2 to 14 (both inclusive) of the Bill seek to
implement the provisions of this Convention.3\. The Merchant Shipping Act,
1958, does not contain any provision regarding prevention of pollution of the
sea by oil. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of
the Sea by Oil, 1954, aims at prohibiting ships from discharging oil or oily
mixture within about hundred miles from the shores of any country which is a
party to the .Convention. Though the problem of pollution of the sea by oil is
not very acute, so far the sea areas around India are concerned, it is
necessary to guard against the problem before it assumes serious proportions
as a result of the increasing tendency to resort more and more to oil as fuel
for ships and the operation of a number of oil refineries in our country
involving the movement of large quantities of crude and refined oil to and
from Indian ports. Further, Indian ships engaged in International trade visit
regularly most of the countries which have ratified the International
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil and unless they
comply with the Convention requirements, they may become liable for heavy
penalties for contravention of the national laws of such countries. Clause 17
of the Bill seeks to give effect to the provisions of the Convention by
inserting a new Part on the subject in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.4\.
Section 352 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, provides for the limitation of
liability of an owner of a ship in respect of any loss of life or personal
injury to any person or any loss of or damage to any property or rights of any
kind caused without his actual fault or privity. In the interest of shipping
and commerce generally, it is desirable that a ship-owner's liability in
respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury or claims for damage to
property is limited to a reasonable amount. Under the Continental system, the
extent of limitation was based on the value of the ship at the end of the
voyage whereas the British practice provided for a fixed rate per ton of the
ship's tonnage. The International Convention on Limitation of Liability of
Owners of Sea-going Ships, 1957, attempts to evolve a uniform international
system of law in this respect and it has already been ratified by Governments
of nine States which account for over 34 per cent. of world tonnage. According
to the provisions of the Convention, it will come into force six months after
one more country ratifies it. Though the monetary limits set to liability by
the Convention are substantially higher than those provided in section 352 of
the Act, in view of the fact that Indian vessels are undertaking voyages to
almost all countries of the world, it would be to the advantage of our
shipping interests to give effect to the provisions of the Convention.
Accepting the Convention would relieve Indian ship-owners of admitting claims
for amounts in excess of what is permitted under the Convention. The more
important deviations from the provisions of the said section 352 which would
become necessary as a result of the acceptance of the Convention may be
summarised as follows:-(1) The limits set to liability under the section have
to be increased in the case of claims for loss of life or personal injury from
rupees two hundred to an amount equivalent to three thousand one hundred gold
francs; in the case of claims for loss of or damage to property from rupees
one hundred for each ton of ship's tonnage to an amount equivalent to one
thousand gold francs; and in the case of claims for both loss of life or
personal injuries and loss of or damage to property from an aggregate amount
of rupees two hundred for each ton of the ship's tonnage to an aggregate
amount equivalent to three thousand one hundred gold francs. (A franc is
approximately equivalent to fifty paise).(2) The benefit of the right to limit
which is available under the said section 352 only to owners of ships will
have to be made available to the charterer, manager and operator of the ship,
and to thq master, members of the crew and other servants of the owner,
charterer, manager or operator acting in the course of their employment.(3)
New provisions will have to be made for the constitution of a limitation fund
on an application made by a ship-owner in that behalf.(4) Clause 16 of the
Bill seeks to give effect to the provisions of this Convention.Statement of
Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 69 of 1976. - The Merchant Shipping Act,
1958, contains inter alia provisions relating to safety and space requirements
of unberthed passenger ships.2\. The Special Trade Passenger Ships Agreement,
1971, and the Protocol on Space Requirements for Special Trade Passenger
Ships, 1973, evolved under the auspices of the inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organizaton, deal with safety and space requirements respectively
applicable to Special Trade Passenger Ships. A Special Trade Passenger Ship is
what is commonly known as an unberthed passenger ship. With the introduction
of "berths" or "bunks" for passengers the 1971 International Conference held
in London considered that the expression "unberthed passenger ships" was a
misnomer. It renamed these ships as "Special Trade Passenger Ships". These
ships are dominantly employed for movement of passengers in developing
countries only. Passengers on these ships generally come from weaker sections
of society. Their capacity to pay the economic level of fares is limited.
Consequently, the amenities which could be provided also get limited.
Influenced by these considerations and by the fact that these ships normally
operated in tropical waters where visibility is usually better and conditions
at sea smoother for the greater part of the year, the International Conference
which adopted the first international convention on safety of life at sea in
1929, permitted administrations to exempt these ships from the requirements of
the convention provided the provisions relating to construction of ships were
complied with to the fullest extent possible and general rules applicable to
these ships were framed in concert with other administrations directly
interested in the carriage of unberthed passengers.3\. The general rules so
formulated (known as the Simla Rules, 1931) still regulate safety requirements
applicable to these passenger ships although the safety requirements
applicable to cargo ships have been considerably stepped up as a result of
emergence of safety conventions of 1948 and 1960. India felt committed to
advocate the cause of safety of nearly 1,00,000 passengers annually travelling
by these ships and endeavoured to step up safety standards applicable to
special trade passenger ships to the extent possible. These efforts have
culminated in the acceptance of the 1971 agreement and accession to the 1973
Protocol.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 1 of 1978. - The
Shipping Development Fund was formed in March, 1959 under section 14 of the
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, with the object of facilitating the growth of
Indian shipping tonnage through grant of loans and financial assistance to
Indian shipping companies for the acquisition and maintenance of ships. The
fund vests in the shipping Development Fund Committee which was constituted
under section 15 of the said Act. This Committee consists wholly of Government
officers. The Committee inter alia charges a documentation fee in respect of
loans and guarantees given by it. The Committee is a non-profit making
organisation and the earnings made by it are incidental to the work connected
with the development of shipping in India. It is, therefore, felt that the
Committee should be exempted from the payment of income-tax, wealth-tax and
any other tax on income, profits or gains on its earnings retrospectively from
the date of its constitution.2\. Section 15 of the Act states that the
Shipping Development Fund Committee shall consist of a Chairman and such
number of other members, not exceeding six, as the Central Government may
think fit to appoint thereto. The activities of the Committee have since
increased. It has become necessary, therefore, to provide for additional
members. It is proposed to increase the number of members from six to
twelve.3\. The corpus of the Shipping Development Fund mainly consists of
amounts granted as loans by the Central Government. It has been observed that
such loans have not always been adequate to meet the entire requirements of
the shipping industry for the expansion of maritime fleet. It is, therefore,
proposed to empower the Shipping Development Fund Committee to resort to
public borrowings through the issue and sale of bonds and debentures.4\. At
present, the shipping companies which obtain loans from the Committee are
required to accept nominees of the Committee to serve on their boards as
directors. Hitherto, the nomination of such directors was being made by mutual
agreement. It is proposed to provide for making such nominations in the Act
itself and that such directions will be granted immunity from legal
proceedings in respect of acts done by them in good faith.5\. Loans from the
Shipping Development Fund are granted to ship-owners who satisfy the
requirements of section 21 of the Act. Indigenous ship building capacity has
been expanding and it is felt that provision may be made in the Act to enable
loans being granted to Indian Ship-yards also for the construction of new
ships.6\. The shipping industry is going through a difficult period all the
world over due to a severe and prolonged depression in the freight market.
Indian shipping companies are also experiencing financial difficulties. It is
felt that provision should be made for the grant of loans to shipping
companies to rehabilitate them from temporary financial difficulties caused by
circumstances beyond their control.7\. The other amendments proposed in the
Bill are minor and consequential in nature.Statement of Objects and Reasons-
Amendment Act 20 of 1979. - The Government of India is responsible for the
training of the Merchant Navy personnel and it incurs substantial expenditure
on the training institutions for the officers. By the drift abroad of the
trained personnel, not only the expenditure incurred on training becomes
infructuous but Indian shipping industry is also handicapped to a great extent
as it is unable to find adequate qualified personnel to man their ships.2\.
With a view to increasing the availability of the trained Merchant Navy
personnel for employment on Indian ships, shorebased establishments, etc., it
is proposed to cast obligation on the holders of certificate of competency and
other certificate under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, to serve for a
certain minimum period on Indian ships, ports and other
establishments.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 43 of 1981. -
The provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, do not permit the
acquisition of an Indian ship by a co-operative society. In the interests of
co-operative movement, particularly in the backward areas, Government feel
that any legal impediment in the way of co-operative efforts should be
removed. This would also help co-operative societies, particularly in remote
areas far away from mainland, to establish a supply, marketing and
distributing system without depending on any commercial shipping
line.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 12 of 1983. - The
amendments proposed in this Bill to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, fall,
from the point of view of their objects and reasons, into different
categories. The various categories of amendments and the objects and reasons
therefor are dealt with in the following paragraphs:-(1) Establishing a regime
of compensation for oil pollution damage.-The International Convention on
Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969 (CLC) establishes an entirely
new regime of compensation and liability on the owners of the ship from which
polluting oil escaped or was discharged. The provisions of the Convention do
not cast any burden direct or indirect on a contracting State either in its
capacity as a flag State or a State importing or exporting oil. In order to
give effect to the substantive provisions of this Convention, a new Part X-B
is being inserted. This will enable India to exercise jurisdiction on foreign
ships in our coastal waters (vide clause 10 of the Bill).(2) Giving effect to
the amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
of Sea by Oil, 1954.-The International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution of Sea by Oil, 1954, has already been ratified by India and effect
to the provisions contained in the said Convention have already been given
effect to by Part XI-A of the Act. For giving effect to the amendments to the
Convention of 1954, which relate to the ban of discharge of oil or oily
mixture anywhere into the sea except at the instantaneous rate of discharge,
it is proposed to substitute the existing Part XI-A of the Act by a new Part
(vide clause 11 of the Bill).(3) Levy of pollution cess.-The amendments
proposed for controlling deliberate discharge and containing accidental escape
of oil into the sea put a heavy financial responsibility on the Central
Government as it has to provide, among others, adequate facilities for
reception of oil residues at the ports. These measures would involve an
expenditure which is likely to run into crores of rupees. This expenditure is
proposed to be re-imbursed to the Government by levying pollution cess on all
ships-Indian or foreign-which carry oil as cargo when they call on Indian
ports. It is proposed to give an enabling power to the Central Government to
levy cess from a date to be notified by that Government (vide clause 11,
section 356-M).(4) Investing powers in the Central Government to protect
interests of Indian shipping from undue foreign intervention.-Shipping
conferences are not generally subject to any Government control and it is
unusual for States to exercise control over International shipping. However,
certain maritime countries have adopted a different attitude and asked certain
Indian shipping companies to produce documents and records held by them in
India. With a view to protecting Indian shipping owners from such arbitrary
measures of foreign States violating the jurisdiction belonging to us, it is
proposed to include a provision which would enable the Central Government to
protect the interests of the Indian companies, vis-a-vis undue intervention by
foreign countries (vide clause 12).(5) Providing for registration and control
of Indian fishing boats as defined in new section 435-B.-The Bill seeks to
insert a new Part XV-A to provide for registration and control of Indian
fishing boats as defined in new section 435-B. This is being done to give
effect to the recommendations of the Fisheries Enquiry Committee. Under the
proposed amendment it will be obligatory for every owner of an Indian fishing
boat to get the same registered at any port or place of registry notified by
the Central Government.(6) Enhancing the penalties provided in section 436 of
the Act.-It is felt that the penalties at present prescribed for the
contravention of the provisions of section 313 of the Act do not seem to have
acted as a deterrent. It is, therefore, proposed to enhance the additional
fine prescribed against serial No. 100 in the Table below section 436(2) from
Rs. 1,000 to 5,000. Also, penalties for the contravention of provisions of
Part XI-A are being enhanced for major pollution offences to the extent of Rs.
10 lakhs and for minor pollution offences to the extent of Rs. 10 thousand.
Penalties for contravention of the provisions of new Part XV-A, relating to
fishing boats, which are akin to sailing vessels, are also being provided
(vide clause 16 of the Bill).(7) Empowering the Central Government to make
rules with respect:to levying fees for various services rendered by surveyors
to shipping industry.-The Central Government provides services of a number of
surveyors and senior officers to the shipping industry. With the adoption of
new International Conventions and Protocols by the International Community on
maritime matters, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at
sea, the protection of maritime environment and training and certification of
ship's officers and crew, the workload on the Mercantile Marine Department,
which is functioning under the Director-General of Shipping, has increased
considerably. This has resulted in the increase of wage bill of technical
staff. In order to meet this expenditure in Part, the Central Government is
being given the power to make rules for levying fees for the services rendered
by the Department to the industry. For this purpose it is proposed to amend
sections 74,87, 175, 282, 344 and 435 of the Act.(8) Amendment of section 2 of
the Act to apply the Act to all vessels including sailing vessels and Indian
fishing boats.-The existing section 2 does not clearly show that the Act would
apply to all vessels including sailing vessels and Indian fishing boats. In
order to remove this lacuna, it is proposed to amend section 2.(9)
Incidentally, this opportunity is availed of to replace the references to the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and the functionaries thereunder by
references to the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the functionaries
thereunder (vide clause 17 of the Bill-Schedule).Statement of Objects and
Reasons-Amendment Act 41 of 1984. - The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 was
enacted over two decades ago. The Act has been amended many a time either to
give effect to the International Conventions on maritime matters or on the
basis of the experience gained in administering the provisions of the Act. The
defects and deficiencies which have come to light subsequent to the amendments
last made, have been further examined by the National Shipping Board, an
Advisory Board on maritime matters constituted under section 4 of the said
enactment. It is considered necessary to give effect to the recommendations of
the National Shipping Board. It is also felt that this opportunity may be
taken to adopt the provisions of the Prevention of Accidents (Seafarers)
Convention, 1970 by incorporating a suitable provision in the Act.2\. Some of
the salient proposals are:-(1) Section 101 of the Act provides that articles
of agreement with the crew shall be signed by the master and the seamen. It is
considered desirable to amend the section by providing that owners or agents
of ships should also be required to sign the agreement so as to bind them to
the obligations cast by the agreement of ship owners with respect to pi;yment
of wages and other provisions protecting the interests of seafarers (vide
clause 4).(2) According to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, employment of
Indian seaman at Indian ports is done only through seamen's employment office.
As an exception, however, section 102 permits the master of a foreign flag
ship to engage a seaman, not being a holder of a certificate of continuous
discharge at a port in India, otherwise than through the seamen's employment
office. Accordingly, whenever there is any casual vacancy on board a foreign
flag ship at an Indian port, the master may either engage an Indian national
who does not hold a certificate of continuous discharge or he may engage a
non-Indian national, whether holder of a certificate of continuous discharge
issued by his country or not. It has been noticed that by and large, masters
of foreign flag ships employ foreigners who often come to Indian ports to
avail of such casual vacancies. Thus, while a certificate of continuous
discharge holding Indian national is debarred from seeking employment,
foreigners of any nationality can seek employment on such basis. In order to
remedy this situation, it is proposed to substitute section 102 so as to
confine the scope to engagement by a foreign flag ship at an Indian port to
seamen who either belong to the flag State or to the State where the rest of
the crew of the ship were engaged, presumption being that in the absence of
such seamen being available at Indian port, employment would naturally be
offered to Indian seamen holding certificate of continuous discharge (vide
clause 5).(3) At present there is no provision in the Act for application of
moneys deposited with shipping masters on behalf of seamen which remain
undisbursed or unclaimed. There are, however, two provisions, namely, section
137(2) and section 141(3) in the Act under which such moneys can be deposited
with the shipping masters. As a welfare measure, it is proposed to make a
provision that if no claim for the moneys so deposited with the shipping
masters is received for a period of six years, then the said amount would,
subject to the orders of the Central Government, be utilised for the welfare
of the seamen (vide clause 8).(4) Section 141(3) provides that any amount
payable by way of compensation to the deceased seamen can be paid to his legal
heirs. As the legal formality required to be completed for establishing an
heir is cumbersome, it is proposed to provide that compensation may be paid to
a person nominated by a seaman, subject to the condition that in the case of a
seaman having a family, the nominee shall be a member of his family. For this
purpose, it is proposed to amend section 141(3) and also to define the
expression "family" in section 3 of the Act (vide clauses 2 and 11).(5)
Section 159(b) provides that for considering eligibility for a claim for
moneys due to a deceased seaman, the shipping master may require production of
a probate, letters of administration or a certificate issued under the Indian
Succession Act. As the procedure for obtaining a certificate under section 29
of the Administrators-General Act, 1963 is more expeditious, it is proposed to
amend this section to make a provision that a certificate issued by the
Administrator-General under section 29 of that Act would also be sufficient
for payment of wages due to a deceased seaman (vide clause 13). This would
facilitate in the early settlement of claims up to the limit of Rs. 50,000
provided for in the said section 29.(6) At present there is no provision in
the Act for the prevention of occupational accidents to seafarers. The
International Labour Organisation has adopted a Convention on the subject and
Government, in consultation with the representatives or organisations of ship
owners and seafarers, proposes to ratify and implement the provisions of the
said Convention. It is accordingly proposed to make a provision in the Act to
confer power on the Central Government to make rules so as to ensure safe
working conditions on Indian ships and for preventing occupational accidents
(vide clause 15).(7) It is proposed to include suitable provision providing
for the insurance of the members of the crew of sailing vessel against death
or personal injury caused by the accident in the course of employment. An
obligation is sought to be cast on the owner of each sailing vessel to take
and keep in force a policy of insurance for this purpose. Provision is also
being made that no sailing vessel shall ply unless there is in force a policy
of insurance for the crew of the sailing vessel and also no Customs Collector
shall grant port clearance to a sailing vessel until after production of a
policy of insurance (vide clause 21).3\. Amongst the other amendments included
in the Bill, mention may be made in particular of the following:-(a) Provision
requiring crew to report any change to the concerned seamen's employment
office (vide clause 6).(b) Authorisation of persons to carry on alterations in
agreement with crew in ports where there are no Indian consular officers (vide
clause 7).(c) Provision to empower the shipping master to decide disputes
involving Rs. 3,000 and below instead of Rs. 300 and below as at present (vide
clause 9).(d) Modification regarding the commencement of payment under an
allotment note laid down in section 137 (vide clause 10).(e) Provision to make
an assault on apprentice, seamen or other persons on the ship also an offence
under section 194 (vide clause 16).(f) Provision to enable the Court to direct
the Government to pay conveyance and daily allowance to the witnesses in
various investigations and inquiries (vide clause 19).(g) Section 436 has been
amended to provide for the punishment for the violation of offence under new
section 434-A (vide clause 22).Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act
33 of 1986. - The International Convention in the Standards of Training,
Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers which was adopted in 1978 at the
Conference organised by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organization (now International Maritime Organization) came into force with
effect from the 28th April, 1984, Government of India ratified the Convention
on the 10th November, 1981. The Convention lays down basic requirements with
respect to training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers in deck,
engine and radio departments and also prescribes the syllabi for examination
of candidates for various certificates and introduction of a number of
training courses aimed at improving the standards of seafarers.2\. Article VI
of the aforesaid Convention prescribes qualifications and standards of
examinations without which no certificate can be granted. Section 80 of the
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 is in conflict with this article as it, inter
alia, provides that any person who has attained the rank of lieutenant in the
executive branch of the Indian Navy shall be entitled to a certificate of a
service as master of a foreign going ship without examination and any person
who has attained the rank of lieutenant or sub-lieutenant in the engineering
branch of the Indian Navy shall be entitled, without examination, to a
certificate of service as first class engineer if he is a lieutenant, and a
certificate of service as second class engineer if he is a sub-lieutenant.3\.
It is, therefore, proposed to omit section 80 of the Merchant Shipping Act,
1958 and make the necessary consequential amendments in certain other
provisions of the Act and also make a suitable saving provision with respect
to certificates of service already granted or recognised under the
Act.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 13 of 1987. - Part VI of
the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, inter alia, provided for manning of officers
for different categories of Indian ships and fishing vessels, grades of
certificates of competency which should be granted, examination for the grant
of such certificates, etc. The existing provisions of this Part were based
generally on accepted international practices in the absence of any
internationally accepted instrument laying down the minimum requirements of
training, syllabi, examination and certification of ship's officers and
watchkeeping crew.2\. In 1978, under the joint auspices of the International
Maritime Organisation and the International Labour Organisation the
International Convention on Standards of Training Certification and
Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 was adopted. This Convention lays down
mandatory minimum requirements for the certification of various officers
working on ships and syllabi for the examination of officers for grant of
various certificates. The Convention entered into force from 28-4-1984. India
ratified it on 6-11-1984 and it came into force for India from 16-2-1985. It
is, therefore, considered necessary to give effect to the provisions of the
Convention by amending the relevant provisions of Part VI of the Merchant
Shipping Act, 1958.3\. The salient proposals are:-(1) While the existing
provisions of Part VI of the Act apply only to Indian ships wherever they are,
it is proposed to apply the amended Part also to foreign-flag ships while they
are at Indian ports or places, because the Convention requires the Contracting
States (and India is a Contracting State) to ensure that any ship calling at
their ports is manned by seafarers possessing the certificates as required by
the Convention. For this purpose existing section 75 is sought to be
substituted by a revised section.(2) It is proposed to substitute the existing
section 76 to bring the manning scales for ships in conformity with the
provisions of the Convention, particularly in relation to watch keeping
requirements, propulsion power of ships, etc. It is also proposed to prescribe
manning scales for fishing vessels in conformity with international
practice.(3) It is proposed to substitute existing section 78 to specify
grades of certificate of competency by retaining some of the existing grades,
revision of nomenclature of some of the existing grades of certificates and
insertion of some grades of certificates in conformity with the Convention. It
is further proposed to insert grades of certificates for dredgers for which
examinations are conducted and also to provide for prescribing the period of
validity of all such certificates.(4) As the Convention requires contracting
States to ensure that any foreign-flag ship calling at its ports or places to
comply with the Convention requirements, it is proposed to insert a new
section 86-A to provide that no foreign-flag ship shall proceed to sea from
any port or place in India unless it has the required number of officers of
appropriate grade as prescribed by the Convention to empower the authorised
surveyor to inspect foreign ships to ensure compliance by such ships of the
Convention requirements and to empower him to detain ships which are found to
be deficient in respect of the Convention requirements.4\. The remaining
amendments included in the Bill are of a minor or consequential
nature.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 55 of 1988. - The Bill
seeks to amend certain provisions of Part X-B of the Merchant Shipping Act,
1958, relating to Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage so as to give
effect to India's accession to the International Convention on Civil Liability
for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the Protocol to that Convention
(hereinafter referred to as the 1976 Protocol).2\. Under the said Convention
of 1969, the liability of the owner of the ship in respect of any one incident
is limited to an aggregate sum of 2,000 francs for each ton of the ship's
tonnage subject to a maximum of 210 million francs. The 1976 Protocol, inter
alia, replaced the reference to frame by Special Drawing Rights. This was done
to avoid problems created by the fluctuations in currencies of different
countries in relation to frame and in conformity with the practice followed in
most of the International Conventions. It is, therefore, necessary to replace
the reference to "franc" in Part X-B of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 by
Special Drawing Rights and to make the necessary consequential
amendments.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 68 of 1993. - One of
the objectives of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, is to foster the
development and ensure the efficient maintenance of an Indian mercantile
marine in a manner best suited to serve the national interests. The National
Shipping Policy also envisaged the country's increasing self-reliance, a
carriage of country's overseas trade in the year 1991-92 the share of Indian
ship in the total overseas trade, was around 35 per cent. only, while
remaining 65 per cent. sea borne trade was carried out by foreign lines.
Development of Shipping in India involves expenditure in foreign exchange as
the country has to import vessels to meet bulk of -its requirements. In view
of the present acute scarcity of foreign exchange Indian companies intending
to acquire ships either new or second hand, from abroad are encountering
serious difficulties in the matter of raising funds in foreign currency from
international banks and in obtaining yard credits. There are certain
provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, with regard to registration,
transfer of ships and rights of mortgages which are perceived as impediments
to the enforcement of the right of the lenders in case of load defaults and
consequent requirement to foreclose the mortgage.Some of the existing
provisions of the Act are perceived by the funding agencies as impediments in
realising the loans in case of default. Certain provisions in the Merchant
Shipping Act, 1958, are also not conducive of attracting foreign investments
in the field of shipping and are not in consonance with the recently announced
Government policies. Therefore, these provisions require suitable
amendments.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 63 of 2002. - The
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 governs matters relating to shipping in India. The
main objective of the Act is to ensure development and efficient maintenance
of the Indian mercantile marine. The Act has been amended from time to time in
the light of experience gained in its implementation and also to give effect
to the provisions of various International Conventions to which India has
acceded.2\. As an active member of the International Maritime Organisation
(IMO), India has acceded to a number of International Conventions and
Protocols adopted by the IMO. Suitable provisions are required to be made in
the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 to enable the Government of India or its
agencies to give effect to those Conventions and Protocols. Besides,
amendments of certain provisions of the Act are also required to enable the
maritime administration to meet its operational requirements.3\. The
Conventions and Protocols for implementation of which provisions are required
to be made in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 are outlined as under:-The
International Maritime Organisation has adopted the International Convention
on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC), 1976 on 19th November,
1976 under which the limitation tonnage is the gross tonnage of the vessel as
calculated under the universal measurement system in accordance with the
Tonnage Measurement of Ships Convention, 1969. The limitation of liability has
been extended to any person for whose neglect or default the shipowner or
salvor is responsible. Limitation of liability will be barred if it is proved
that the loss resulted from any personal act or omission committed by the
shipowner or the salvor with the intent to cause such loss or committed
recklessly and with the knowledge that such loss would probably result. The
Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, 1974 was amended in 1988 to
streamline and harmonise the survey of ships and their equipment to ensure
safety of ships proceeding on sea voyages. The Convention on Load Lines, 1966
as amended in 1988 deals with harmonised system of survey of ships and their
certification. The Civil Liability Convention (CLC), 1992 mainly deals with
payment for oil pollution damages by any ship in the Indian waters up to
limits of exclusive economic zone and by any Indian ship abroad. The Fund
Convention, 1992 provides a second tier of compensation regime where a
claimant can proceed against the Fund located in London that pays for
damages.4\. The Bill seeks to amend various provisions of the Act, which,
inter alia, include the following, namely:-(i) sections 76 and 87 are being
amended to empower the Central Government to prescribe different manning
scales for different types of ships and section 95 is being amended to
redefine the role of seamen's employment offices to control and regulate the
manning agents and recruitment and placement service instead of controlling
and regulating the employment of seamen. Section 97 is being amended to bring
the unions within its purview to enable curbing of malpractices by the
seamen's unions and a new section 97-A is being inserted to prohibit any
discrimination in recruitment of seafarers;(ii) sections 299, 299-A, 300, 301,
303 and 307 are being amended to include the changes made in SOLAS Convention,
1974 3s amended in 1988. Section 317 is being amended to implement the
provisions of the Load Lines Convention, 1966 as amended in 1988 to harmonise
the survey and certification procedures with those of SOLAS Convention, 1974
as amended in 1988;(iii) section 344 is being amended to empower the Central
Government to prescribe the record of equipment and the manner of surveys to
be made in respect of ships;(iv) sections 352, 352-A, 352-B, 352-C, 352-D and
352-E are being amended to enable the Central Government to implement the
provisions of the LLMC, 1976. A new section 352-FA is being added to empower
the Central Government to frame rules;(v) sections 352-H, 352-I, 352-J and
352-R are being amended to implement the provisions of CLC, 1992;(vi) new
sections 352-S to 352-ZA are being inserted for implementation of the
provisions of the Fund Convention, 1992;(vii) consequent to amendment to
section 352-A, section 116 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 is being amended
to provide for recovery of damage to the port properties in accordance with
the provisions of Part X-A of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958;(viii) the
Indian ships which carry country's commercial trade to the outside world are
subjected to control of the Port State which has the right to inspect such
ships. Hence, the Indian ships are required to carry internationally valid
survey certificates issued in accordance with the procedures established by
the International Maritime Organisation but for which they will be required to
undergo surveys at foreign ports at the time they call at those ports. The
proposed amendments of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 will enable the
Government of India to take care of these aspects.5\. The Bill seeks to
achieve the above objects.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 59 of
2003. - The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 governs matters relating to shipping
in India. The main objective of the Act is to ensure development and efficient
maintenance of the Indian mercantile marine. The Act has been amended, from
time to time, in the light of experience gained in its implementation and also
to give effect to the provisions of various International Conventions to which
India has acceded.2\. As an active member of the International Maritime
Organisation (IMO), India has acceded to a number of International Conventions
and Protocols adopted by the IMO. Suitable provisions are required to be made,
from time to time, in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 to enable the Government
of India or its agencies to give effect to those Conventions and Protocols.3\.
The International Maritime Organisation adopted in 1973 the International
Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL 1973) which
was amended by adoption of Protocol in 1978. The MARPOL 1973 and Protocol of
1978 thereto, together known as MARPOL 73/78, seeks to achieve complete
elimination of pollution of the marine environment by oil and other harmful
substances and minimization of accidental discharge of such substances by
prescribing a package of requirements of design, construction, survey and
certification norms with respect to discharge of sewage and garbage into the
sea.4\. The Bill seeks to amend sections 356-A, 356-B, 356-C, 356-D, 356-E,
356-F, 356-G, 356-H, 356-I, 356-J, 356-K and 356-0 of Part XI-A of the Act
which is considered necessary following India' accession to Annexures III, IV
and V of MARPOL 73/78 and to enable maritime administration to enforce the
provisions of MARPOL 73/78.5\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
objects.Statement of Objects and Reasons-Amendment Act 40 of 2007. - India has
ratified the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (SOLAS
1974) on 16th June, 1976 which came into force on 25th May, 1980. This
Convention in its successive forms is generally regarded as the most important
of all international treaties concerning the safety of merchant ships. The
main objective of the SOLAS 1974 is to specify minimum standards for the
construction, equipment and operation of ships, compatible with their safety.
There are 11 Codes or similar instruments that are made mandatory under SOLAS
1974. Of these, the last Code is the 'International Code for the Security of
Ships and Port Facility' (ISPS Code). This Code was adopted as an amendment to
SOLAS 1974 by the conference of contracting States on 12th December, 2002, by
passing 11 resolutions. Resolution 6 prescribes 1st July, 2004 as the
application date for the Code. The objectives of the ISPS Code are to
establish an international framework involving co-operation between
contracting States, Government agencies, local administrations and the
shipping and port industries to detect or assess security threats and take
preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port
facilities used in international trade; to establish the respective roles and
responsibilities of all concerned at the national and international level for
ensuring maritime security; to ensure the early and efficient collation and
exchange of security related information; to provide a methodology for
security assessments so as to have in place plans and procedures to react to
changing security levels and; to ensure adequate and proportionate maritime
security measures. If the ISPS Code is not implemented, it will be difficult
for the Indian ships to secure entry in the ports of other contracting States
and also for the foreign ships to visit Indian Ports. The present text of the
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 and the Indian Ports Act, 1908 do not contain the
provisions addressing the above.2\. With a view to implement the provisions of
the ISPS Code, it is proposed to amend the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 so as
to incorporate therein provisions relating to security measures to be adopted
by ships and port facilities, ship identification number, port facility
assessment, international ship security certificate, ship security alert
system, control measures and compliance. India being a major seafarer
supplying nation, it is essential to ensure that our seafarers' employment
prospects and movements to other countries are not hampered for want of
Seaferers' identity document. Accordingly, it is proposed to incorporate
necessary provisions in the Bill.3\. Since the implementation of ISPS Code
also involves ports, it is proposed to consequentially amend the Indian Ports
Act, 1908 so as to facilitate a port facility in complying with the
requirements of the maritime security proposed to be included under the new
Part IX-B of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.4\. The Bill seeks to achieve the
above objects.[30th October, 1958]An Act to foster the development and ensure
the efficient maintenance of an Indian mercantile marine in a manner best
suited to serve the national interests and for that purpose to establish a

engaged in or belonged to the ship, and either that he left the ship before
the completion of the voyage or engagement or, if the voyage was to terminate
in India and the ship has not retuned, that he is absent from her and that an
entry of his desertion has been duly made in the official log book.(2)The
desertion shall thereupon, so far as relates to any forfeiture of wages under

a proper certificate of discharge or can otherwise show to the satisfaction of
the Court that he had sufficient reasons for leaving his ship.

### 200. Application of forfeitures. -

accordingly.

proceeding.

agreement shall be deducted and paid over as follows, namely:-(a)if the
offender is discharged at any port or place in India and the offence and such
entries in respect thereof as aforesaid are proved to the satisfaction of the
shipping master before whom the offender is discharged, the master or owner
shall deduct such fine from the wages of the offender and pay the same over to
such shipping master; and(b)if the seaman is discharged at any port or place
outside India and the offence and such entries as aforesaid are proved to the
satisfaction of the Indian consular officer, by whose sanction he is so
discharged, the fine shall thereupon be deducted as aforesaid, and an entry of
such deduction shall then be made in the official log book, if any, and signed
by such officer and on the return of the ship to India, the master or owner
shall pay over such fine to the shipping master before whom the crew is
discharged.(2)An act of misconduct for which any such fine has been inflicted

seafaring person to whom the master of a ship is under the authority of this
Act or any other law compelled to take on board and convey and every person
who goes to sea in a ship without such consent as aforesaid shall, so long as
he remains in the ship, be subject to the same laws and regulations for

arriving at any port or place in or outside India and the master of any ship
other than an Indian ship arriving at any port or place in India shall, if any

imprisonment. -

impracticable to procure the attendance of any person named in such list, a
person of nautical engineering or other special skill and experience. If the
surveyor and assessor agree that the ship should be detained or released, the
Central Government shall cause the ship to be detained or released
accordingly, and the owner or master shall have no right of appeal. If the
surveyor and assessor differ in their report, the Central Government may act
as if the requisition had not been made, and the owner or master shall have a
right of such appeal touching the report of the surveyor as is hereinbefore
provided in this section.(f)Where a ship has been provisionally detained, the
Central Government may at any time if it thinks it expedient, refer the matter
