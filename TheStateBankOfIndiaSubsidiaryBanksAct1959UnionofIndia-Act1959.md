### 1352.

The future of certain major State-associated banks which are owned in part of
the State Governments or with which such Governments have been closely
associated has been under consideration for some time. The question has
recently been comprehensively re-examined, with particular reference to the
necessity for making adequate and proper provision for the management of
treasuries and sub-treasuries in the area served by these banks and the need
for the expansion of these banks in these areas; and the views of the banks
themselves have been ascertained.2\. The managements and shareholders of the
Bank of Bikaner, the Bank of Indore, the Bank of Jaipur, the Bank of Mysore
and the Travancore Bank have agreed to the proposal to reconstitute these
banks as subsidiaries of the State Bank and the Government of Bombay and the
Punjab as well as the Reserve Bank of India have agreed to the reconstitution
on similar lines of the State Bank of Saurashtra, the Bank of Patiala and the
State Bank of Hyderabad respectively.3\. The scheme for reconstitution
provides for the transfer to and vesting in the State Bank of India of the
share capital of each of he eight banks which have accepted to proposals.
Compensation will be payable to the existing shareholders (including a State
Government or the Reserve Bank of India as the case may be) on the basis of
the excess of the assets over the liabilities, representing the real value of
the paid-up capital. Such compensation will be determined , in the event of a
dispute, by an impartial tribunal, in accordance with the principles indicated
in the Bill.4\. Provision is being made for minority shareholding by private
shareholders up to 45 per cent. of the issued capital in the case of each of
the reconstituted banks. The management and administration of the
reconstituted institutes will be entrusted to Boards of Directors on which the
State Bank of India will be adequately represented. The other provisions made
in the Bill are generally based on those contained in the State Bank of India
Act, 1955 - Gazette of India, 1959, Extra, Pt. II, Section 2, page 274.[10th
September, 1959.]An Act to provide for the formation of certain Government or
