**_Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Sixty-sixth
Amendment) Bill, 1990 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Sixty-sixth
Amendment) Act, 1990_****STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS** Article 31B of the
Constitution confers on the enactments included in the Ninth Schedule to the
Constitution immunity from legal challenge on the ground that they violate the
fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.

### 2. In the past, whenever it was found that progressive legislation,
conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation, recourse
was taken to the Ninth Schedule. Several State enactments relating to land
reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included
in the Ninth Schedule. Since the Government is committed to give importance to
land reforms, it is decided to include all land reform laws in the Ninth
Schedule so that they are not challenged before the courts. The State
Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka,
Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West
Bengal, Tamil Nadu and administration of the Union territory of Pondicherry
have suggested the inclusion of some of their Acts relating to land reforms in
the Ninth Schedule.

### 3. Since the amendment to Acts which are already placed in the Ninth
Schedule are not automatically immunized from legal challenge, some amending
Acts are also proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule. The Acts which
are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule have been examined. In order
to ensure that implementation of these Acts is not adversely affected by
litigation, it is proposed to include them in the Ninth Schedule.

### 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.

in the Forty-first Year of the Republic of India as follows:-

[The Constitution (Sixty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1990, was enacted in 1990 by
amending the 9th schedule, which was added by the 1st Amendment and
established by Article 31B. According to the 9th schedule, all the Central and
State laws in the list cannot face legal challenges. As per this amendment of
the Indian constitution Act, 55 land reforms were included in the 9th schedule
by various States to protect them from judicial scrutiny. Considering the fact
that amendment to Acts currently in the Ninth Schedule is also not exempt from
the judicial challenge, some modifying Acts are also recommended to be
incorporated into the Ninth Schedule. By including them in the 9th Schedule to
the Constitution, the Act shields 55 State acts relating to land reforms and
caps on agricultural land holdings that were passed by the States of Bihar,
Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and
administration of the Union Territory of Puducherry from legal challenge.Also
