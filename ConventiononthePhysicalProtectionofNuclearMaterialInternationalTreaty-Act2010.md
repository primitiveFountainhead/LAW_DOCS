### 3\. In implementing the obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2, each State
Party shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Convention,
apply in so far as is reasonable and practicable the following Fundamental
Principles of Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities.

Fundamental Principle A: Responsibility of the StateThe responsibility for the
establishment, implementation and maintenance of a physical protection regime
within a State rests entirely with that State.Fundamental Principle B:
Responsibilities During International TransportThe responsibility of a State
for ensuring that nuclear material is adequately protected extends to the
international transport thereof, until that responsibility is properly
transferred to another State, as appropriate.Fundamental Principle C:
Legislative And Regulatory FrameworkThe State is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a legislative and regulatory framework to govern physical
protection. This framework should provide for the establishment of applicable
physical protection requirements and include a system of evaluation and
licensing or other procedures to grant authorization. This framework should
include a system of inspection of Nuclear facilities and transport to verify
compliance with applicable requirements and conditions of the license or other
authorizing document, and to establish a means to enforce applicable
requirements and conditions, including effective sanctions.Fundamental
Principle D: Competent AuthorityThe State should establish or designate a
competent authority which is responsible for the implementation of the
legislative ami regulatory framework, and is provided with adequate authority,
competence and financial and human - resources to fulfill its assigned
responsibilities. The State should take steps to ensure an effective
independence between the functions of the State's competent authority and
those or any other body in charge of the promotion or utilization of nuclear
energy.Fundamental Principle E: Responsibility, of the License HoldersThe
responsibilities for implementing the various elements of physical protection
within a State should be clearly identified. The State should ensure that the
prime responsibility for the implementation of physical protection of nuclear
material or of nuclear facilities rests with the holders of the relevant
licenses or of other authorizing documents (e.g., operators or
shippers).Fundamental Principle F: Security CultureAll organizations involved
in implementing physical protection should give due priority, to the security
