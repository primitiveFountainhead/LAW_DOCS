### 15.

/733Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The question of establishing a statutory
com-posite Central Council for Indian systems of medicine (Ayurveda, Siddha
and Unani) and Homoeopathic system of medicine, on the analogy of Medical
Council of India has been under consideration of the Government of India for
some time past.2\. Minimum standards for admission, duration of courses of
training, details of curricula and syllabi of studies and the title of the
degree or diploma vary from State to State and even from institution to
institution in the same State. A number of Committees appointed by the
Government of India to consider problems relating to the Indian system of
medicine and Homoeopathy have recommended that a statutory Central Council on
the lines of the Medical Council of India for modern system of medicine is a
prerequisite for the proper development of these systems of medicine.3\. Some
States have constituted State Boards or Councils, either by legislation or by
executive orders for the purpose of registration of practitioners in the
various systems of Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy as well as recognition of
qualifications. There is, however, no Central legislation for the regulation
of practice or for minimum standards of training and conduct of examinations
in these systems of medicine on an all-India basis. In the absence of such
legislation there is no effective control over the large number of
unregistered practitioners in these systems.4\. The Central Council of Health
at its 13th meeting in June, 1966, while discussing the policy on Ayurvedic
education, recommended the setting up of a Central Council for Indian systems
of Medicine to lay down and regulate standards of education and examinations,
qualifications and practice in these systems.5\. The main functions of the
Central Council would be to evolve uniform standards of education in and
registration of the practitioners of these systems of Indian Medicine and
Homoeopathy. For this purpose the Central Council will constitute separate
committees for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy, consisting of members
of the respective systems of medicine to deal with matters pertaining to those
systems. The registration of practitioners on the Central Register of Indian
Medicine and Homoeopathy will ensure that medicine is not practised by those
who are not qualified in these systems, and those who practise observe a code
of ethics in the profession.6\. The Bill is intended to achieve these
objects.Amendment Act 52 of 2002-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Indian
Medicine Central Council Act. 1970 was enacted for the constitution of Central
Council of Indian Medicine so as to maintain a Central Register of Ayurveda,
Siddha and Unani practitioners and to regulate education and practice of
Indian systems of medicine.2\. Experience in implementing the provisions of
the Act has brought to light certain glaring inadequacies due to which the
Central Council has been unable to enforce the provisions of the Act in letter
and spirit. Presently, there are 196 colleges of Ayurveda, 35 of Unani and 5
of Siddha system of medicine spread over 20 States of the country. Annual
admission capacity of these colleges for graduate course of Ayurveda is 7730
and for postgraduate courses 752. As many as 73 Ayurveda colleges were
permitted by the Central Council from 1995 to 2001, out of which 45 are
located in the States of Maharashtra and Karnataka alone. These two States
have more than half of the total number of colleges in the country. There
hasbeen enormous proliferation of sub-standard colleges during the last 5-6
years and almost all the new colleges happen to be from the private sector. It
has been observed that the behaviour of the Central Council is contrary to its
duties and responsibilities and it has not been able to act judiciously to
enforce minimum standards of education as is required under the regulations
made under the Act.3\. Recently, it has been observed that some State
Governments give approval for the opening of new colleges in Indian Systems of
the Medicine on their own, without insisting on the provision of basic
facilities for teaching and training. It was also observed that even executive
members of the Central Council have been included in the college inspection
teams despite clear directions from the Ministry for not deputing such members
for the purpose because they have to approve or disapprove the colleges on the
basis of inspection reports. A disturbing trend has also been noticed that the
Central Council has been meticulous in pointing out deficiencies in the
Government-non-colleges but has ignored similar deficiencies in private
colleges. There are instances when colleges being permitted in the first year
were denied permission in subsequent years. Phenomenon of taking partisan
decisions to permit one college and to deny permission to another college
having similar infrastructure has also been noted. The procedure adopted for
increasing and decreasing the seats has also been far from satisfactory. Seats
are increased or decreased without proper evaluation. The Central Government
is not in a position to take corrective steps as it has neither the power to
intervene nor it can give any direction to the Central Council. Thus it has
not been possible to ensure objectivity in the functioning of the Central
Council. Above all, there is no provision in the Act, which puts an obligation
on the colleges to seek approval of the Central Council for starting the
courses of study in Indian Systems of Medicine.4\. In these circumstances, the
Central Government has considered it advisable in the public interest to bring
in necessary amendment to the Act so as to empower the Central Government to
regulate opening of new colleges in the Indian Systems of Medicine,
introduction of new or higher courses of study and increase in their admission
capacity. This would ensure that colleges with minimum standards alone are
permitted to stan, in addition to ensuring objectivity and uniformity in their
functioning.5\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.[21st December,

Medicine and the maintenance of a Central Register of Indian Medicine and for
