[See Clause 28(1)(b) and 29]

## Part A  Procedure for Drawal of Samples of Fertilizers

### 1\. General requirements of sampling - In drawing samples, the following
measures and precautions should be observed :

(a)samples shall not be taken at a place exposed to rain/sun;(b)the sampling
instruments shall be clean and dry when used ;(c)the material being sampled,
the sampling instrument and the bags of samples should be free from any
adventitious contamination ;(d)to draw a representative sample, the contents
of each bag selected for sampling should be mixed as thoroughly as possible by
suitable means ;(e)the sample should be kept in suitable, clean dry and air
tight glass or screwed hard polythene bottle of about 400 gms. capacity or in
a thick gauged polythene bag. This should be put in a cloth bag which may be
sealed with the inspector's seal after putting inside the detailed description
as specified in Form 'J'. Identifiable details may also be put on the cloth
bag like sample No/code No. or any other details which enables its
identification ;(f)each sample bag should be sealed air tight after filling
and marked with details of sample type and brand of fertiliser, name of
dealer/manufacturer and the name of Inspector who has collected sample.

### 2\. Sampling from bagged material : -

(i)Scale of sampling. - (a) Lot (for manufacturers). - All bags, in single
consignment of the material of the sample grade and type drawn from a single
batch of the manufacture shall constitute a lot. If a consignment is declared
to consist of different batches of manufacture, all the bags of each batch
shall constitute a separate lot.In the case of a consignment drawn from a
continuous process, 2000 bags (or 100 tonnes) of the material shall constitute
a lot.(b)Lot (for dealers). - The lot is an identifiable quantity of same
grade and type of fertiliser stored at an identifiable place subject to a
maximum limit of 100 tonnes.The lot shall be identified by the inspector based
on visible appearance of bags, their packing and storage conditions. The stock
of less than 100 tonnes with a dealer may also constitute one or more lots, if
the material (fertilizer) of different sources and brand is available in such
quantities.(c)(i)Selection of bags for sampling. - The number of bags to be
chosen from a lot shall depend upon the size of the lot as given in the table
below :

Lot Size (no. of bags)(N) |  No. of bags to be selected for sampling(N)  
---|---  
Less than 1010 - 100100 - 200200 - 400400 - 600600 - 800800 - 10001000 - 13001300 - 16001600 - 2000 |  12345678910  
  
All the bags of a lot should be arranged in a systematic manner. Start
counting from any bag randomly, go on counting as 1,2,3 up to r and so on, r
being equal to the integral of N/n. Thus, every rth bag counted shall be
withdrawn and all bags shall constitute the sample bags from where the sample
is to be drawn for preparing a composite sample.(ii)Sampling from big
godown/high stackings. - If the procedure given in Para 2(i)(c) is not
possible to be adopted, the sample should be drawn from the randomly selected
fertiliser bags from different layers, from top and from all open sides in a
zig zag fashion.(iii)Sampling from small godowns. - All the fertilizer bags of
the same grade and type of each manufacturer though received on different
dates shall be segregated and properly stacked. All bags of grade and type of
fertiliser manufactured by particular manufacturing unit may be considered as
one lot based on their physical conditions and the sample shall be drawn as
per procedure laid down in Paras 2(i) (c) and 4.(iv)Sampling from damaged
stock. - (a) In case of torn or lumpy bags, damaged fertiliser bags or
sweepings, the stock should be arranged according to identifiable lots. From
each lot the number of bags shall be selected as per procedure (2) (i) (c) if
the bags allow the use of Sampling probe conveniently, the samples should be
drawn sampling probe.(b)In case it is not possible to use the sampling probe,
the bags may be opened and fertiliser material mixed together uniformally by
hammering the big lumps or putting pressure if required, and then samples
drawn by using suitable sample device.

### 3\. Sampling probe -

(i)An appropriate sampling instrument to be used by the Inspectors for
collection of a representative sample is called Sampling probe. The probe may
comprise of a slotted single tube with solid conetip made of stainless steel
or brass. The length of the probe may be approximately 60 to 65 cms. and the
diameter of the tube may be approximately 1.5 cms. and the slot width may be
1.2 to 1.3 cms. The probe may be used if the physical condition of the
fertilisers and the packing material permits its use.(ii)In case of High
Density Polyethylene Packings and also when the fertiliser material is not in
free flowing condition, the use of sampling probe may not be possible, in such
a case, selected bags for drawing samples may be opened and the fertilizers
may be taken out of the bags and spread on a clean surface and samples drawn
with the help of a suitable sampling device which may be made of stainless
steel or brass cup.

### 4\. Drawal of samples from bags -

(i)Drawal of sample and preparation of composites. Draw, with an appropriate
sampling instrument, (sampling probe) small portions of the material from the
selected bags as per procedure in Paras 2(i)(b), 2(11), 2(iii) and 2(iv) (a).
The Sampling probe shall be inserted in the bag from one corner to another
diagonally and when filled with fertiliser, the probe is withdrawn and
fertiliser is emptied in a container/or on polythene sheet/or on a clean hard
surface and made into one composite sample.(ii)If the bags do not permit the
use of sampling probe empty the contents of the bags on a level, clean and
hard surface and drawn a composite sample by the process of quartering as
described under Para 3(11) or 5.(iii)[ In case of chelated micronutrients and
mixtures of micronutrients, the three identical containers of the batch,
grade, type and manufacturer, shall be selected which shall constitute the
composite samples, provided it is not possible to draw a composite sample of
the size given under Paragraph 4 - A (iii)] [Added by S.O. 354(E), dated 3rd
June 1993.];["4A. Weight of one sample.] [Added by S.O. 354(E), dated 3rd June
1993] -One sample of fertiliser shall have the approximate weight, as
specified below : -

(i) For straight micronutrient fertiliser | 100 gms  
---|---  
(ii) For chelated micronutrient, fertiliser and mixture of orthe maximum packing size of similar quantity. | 50 gms  
(iii) For other fertilisers and mixtures of fertilisers | 400 gms  
  
### 5\. Preparation of composite sample. -

If the composite sample collected from the different selected bags is larger
than [required weight] [Substituted by S.O. 354(E), dated 3rd June 1993.] its
size shall be reduced by method of quartering as detailed below : -Spread the
composite sample on a level, clean, hard surface, flatten it out and divide it
into four equal parts. Remove any diagonally opposite parts. Mix the two
remaining parts together to form a cone, flatten out the cone and repeat the
operation of quartering till a composite sample of [required weight]
[Substituted by S.O. 354(E), dated 3rd June 1993.] is obtained.

### 6\. Preparation of test sample and reference sample :

(i)The composite sample obtained above shall be spread out on a clean, hard
surface and divided into three approximately equal portions [each of the
weight as specified in paragraph 8] [Substituted by S.O. 354(E), dated 3rd
June, 1993.]. Each of these samples shall constitute the test sample.(ii)Each
test sample shall be immediately transferred to a suitable container as
defined under Para 1(e). The slip with detailed description may be put inside
the sample bag. Each bag shall also be properly labelled as mentioned in Para
1(f).(iii)Each test sample container shall then be sealed with the seals of
the inspector. If possible, seal of the manufacturer/dealer or purchaser as
the case may also be affixed.(iv)One sample so sealed shall be sent to the
Incharge of the Laboratory notified by the State Government under Clause 29 or
Central Fertiliser Quality Control and Training Institute, Faridabad for
analysis and the second given to the manufacturer or dealer or the purchaser
as the case may be. The third sample shall constitute the reference sample and
shall be sent by the inspector to his next higher authority for keeping in
safe custody for production in Court, if required.

### 7\. Sampling from the bulk fertilisers in ships, bulk carriers and bulk
containers :

(i)Sampling equipments : - (a) Sampling cup - The sampling cup can be
fabricated from non - corrosive metal. Inside dimensions of cup mouth may be
3/4" x 10" as per the diagram of the sampling cup given in Figure - A below :
-Fig. A - Sampling Cup(b)Sampling probe for bulk fertilisers. - The sampling
probe should be made of non - corrodable material such as stainless steel or
brass. It may be a slotted double tube with solid cone tip having a length of
about 41/2" - 5" and diameter of about 11 1/4" - 5" to 11 1/2".(c)Scope. -
Samples from the hatch can also be collected by a suitable scoop made of
stainless steel or brass.(ii)Sampling Procedure: - (a) Drawal of samples from
the ship of bulk fertilisers -A. Sampling from conveyor belt. - When the
material is unloaded from the ships and transported to temporary/storage
godowns through conveyor belts. the sample can be drawn by passing the
sampling cup through the entire stream of material as the material drops from
a transfer belt or spout. The long slot in the top of sampling cup should be
prependicular to the falling stream. Pass the cup through the complete stream
at an uniform speed, so that the cup will collect approximately equal amounts
in each pass but will never over.A minimum of 10 equally timed and speed
stream must be taken during the transfer operation. However, the stream
samples are not applicable unless uniform continuous flow of fertiliser is
maintained for more than 3 minutes while lot is being sampled.B. Sampling from
hatch. - In case of bulk fertilisers, from each hatch, at least 5 - 6
composite samples should be drawn from different depths and different points
during unloading operation. To make one composite sample, minimum 5 samples
should be drawn from different points at a specific depth. All these samples
should be mixed to make one composite sample. The depths may be 0 - 5 m., 10 -
15 m. and 20 - 25 m. depending upon the depth of hatch. The samples at a
particular depth should be drawn after removal of material up to the required
depth. The samples may be drawn with the help of sampling probe or
scoop.(b)Drawal of samples from bulk carriers - trucks etc. - The Samples can
be drawn as per vertical probing procedure of Association of official
Analytical Chemists. The sampling probe should be about 41/2" to 5" length.
Draw 10 vertical cuts from the following locations relative of the entire top
of the conveyance. The 10 vertical cores are combined into a composite
samples.

be sampled at the points illustrated in Fig. C Withdraw one vertical core of
material from locations 1 and 6 and two cores at locations 2,3,4 and 5.
Composite all the probe samples and prepare the composite samples for analysis
as per procedure laid down in Paras 1, 5 & 6.Fig. B - Sample points for Coned
or Ridged pile.Fig.C - Sample points for 1/2 on one side Pile

### 8\. Method of sampling of anhydrous ammonia : -

(i)Scoop. - This method is for use in obtaining samples of anhydrous ammonia.
The method is based on the assumption that the material to be sampled is as
claimed and contains only a small amount of impurity primarily water. It is
recommended that duplicate samples be taken from each tank or vessel
sampled.(ii)Apparatus - (a) Tubes for sampling tubes, heat resistant glass,
conical centrifuge type 200 ml with lower 100 ml. graduated from 0.2 ml in
0.05 ml division, 2 - 4 ml. in 0.1 division 4 - 10 ml. in 0.5 ml. divisions
and 10 - 100 ml. 1.0 nil divisions. Tube type shown in figure E.(b)Stoppers
for tubes, rubber, with bent tube vent as in figure E.(c)Sample carrier,
constructed of plywood or aluminium as in figure E.(d)Sampling line and
connection assembly constructed as in figure D, with flexible steel sampling
nose 48" long, 1/4" NPT coupling at each end and 1/8" insulated steel delivery
tip at one end.(e)Sample tube adapter, constructed from rubber stopper and 6
mm. OD, glass or steel tubing as in figure E.(f)Protective equipment : Rubber
or other non - prorous gloves, offering complete protection to the hands and
lower arms, full coverage goggles or approved gas mask.Sampling Line &
ConnectionFig. E(iii)Reagents. - Charcoal, regent, 14 - 20 mesh.Note. - If the
sample is expected to contain excessive amount of water (one per cent or
more), one piece of the charcoal may be added to each before introduction of
the sample.(iv)Procedure. - (a) Place two dry, clean sampling tubes in the
sample carrier.(b)Connect the sampling line connection assembly to the
unloading valve of the tank, vessel or line to be sampled.(c)Open the valves
slowly and purge the sampling line connection assembly thoroughly by venting 3
to 4 litres of ammonia. Close the samples line globe valve.(d)Remove the
vented stoppers from the tubes and insert the adapter end of the sampling line
connection assembly.(e)Open the sample line valve and slowly fill the sampling
tube to the 100 ml. mark, close the sample line valve.(f)Remove the sampling
line adapter and insert the vented stopper in the sampling tube.(g)Repeat
steps, d and e and f and fill the second tube.(h)Close tank discharge valve
and remove the sampling line connection assembly.(i)Either know or note the
vessel, container, or line pressure of material sampled.(j)Tag the collected
samples for identification and submit to the laboratory for processing by
following methods in this section.(v)Precaution. - (a) Liquid anhydrous
ammonia causes severe burns on contact. It evaporates readily releasing the
gas which may cause carrying degrees of irritation of the skin and mucus
membrances and may injure severly the respiratory mucosa with possible fatal
outcome.(b)Avoid contacting liquid ammonia. In case of contact, immediately
flush the affected parts with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Get
medical attention at once in case of burns, especially to the eyes, nose and
throat, or if the victim is unconscious.(c)Ammonia gas in concentrations of
6,000 to 10,000 ppm. (by volume) is lethal within a few minutes. Irritation of
the eyes, respiratory tract and throat results from concentrations as low as
500 to 1,000 ppm., a concentration of 2,000 ppm produces conclusive coughing
and may be fatal after a short exposure, i.e., less than half an hour. The
maximum concentration tolerated by the skin for more than few seconds is 2 per
cent (i.e. when suitable respiratory protection is worn). The maximum
allowable concentration for 8 hour working exposure is 50 ppm. This is the
least detectable order.(d)Obtain medical attention if exposure to the gas
produce distress of any type.(e)Rubber or other non - porous gloves, offering
complete protection to the hands and lower arms must be worn when sampling
anhydrous ammonia. Full coverage goggles must also be worn to protect the eyes
unless an approved gas mask is used. The gas mask need only to be used if
sampling cannot be done without possible inhalation of the vapours.

## Part B  Methods of Analysis of Fertilizers

### 1\. Preparation of sample for analysis in the laboratory :

(i)Procedure. - (a) Reduce gross sample to quantity sufficient for analysis or
grand not 250 gms. of reduced sample without previous sieving.(b)For
fertiliser materials and moist fertiliser mixtures, that form a paste on
putting pressure, grind in porcelain pestle and mortar to pass sieve with 1
mm. circular opening or No. 20 standard sieve.(c)For dry mixtures that tend to
segregate, grind in a porcelain pestle and mortar to pass No. 40 standard
sieve.(d)Grind as rapidly as possible to avoid loss or gain of moisture during
operation.(e)Mix thoroughly and store in tightly stoppered bottles.

### 2\. Determination of moisture : -

(Not applicable to samples that yield volatile substances other than water at
drying temperature).(i)Procedure. - (a) Weight to the nearest mg. about 2 gms.
of the prepared sample in a weighted, clean, dry squat form weighing
bottle.(b)Heat in an oven for about 5 hours at 99 - 101C to constant weight.
Cool in a desicator and weight.(c)In case of sodium nitrate, ammonium sulphate
and potassium salts heat to constant weight at 129 - 131C.(d)Report
percentage loss in weight as moisture at temperature used.Calculations

Free moisture percent by weight = | 100 (B  C)___________B - A  
---|---  
  
A = Weight of the bottle.B = Weight of the bottle plus material before
drying.C = Weight of the bottle plus material after drying.(Reference "Methods
of Analysis", AOAC, 1965)(ii)Moisture in ammonium Chloride. - (a) Weight
accurately about 5 gms. of prepared sample in a weighed shallow porcelain dish
and dry for 24 hours in a vacuum desicator over sulphuric acid and re -
weight.(b)Preserve the dried material for subsequent
tests.CalculationsMoisture per cent by weight = 100 x W1/W3W= Loss in weight
in gm. in drying, andW3 = Weight in gm. of the papered sample taken for
test.(iii)Samples. - Like urea, diammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrate
which yield volatile substances other than water at drying temperature, the
Karl Fishcher method given below is used for the determination of
moisture.(iv)Reagents. - (a) Iodine solution. - Added 125 gm. of iodine to a
mixture of 650 ml. of methanol and 200 ml. of pyridine contained in flask, and
immediately close the flask tightyly.(b)Sulphur dioxide solution. - Pass dry
sulphur dioxide into 100 ml. of pyridine contained in a 250 ml. graduated
cylinder and cooled in an ice bath, until the volume reaches 200
ml.(c)Fishcher reagent. - Slowly add iodine solution to cooled sulphur dioxide
solution, stopper immediately and shake well until the iodine is dissolved.
Transfer the solution to an automatic pipette, protected from absorption of
moisture by a drying agent and allow to stand for 24 hours before
standardising. The reagent deteriorates continuously and it should be
standardized within one hour before use.(d)Standard water solutions. - Measure
exactly 2 ml. of water into a thoroughly dry 1 litre volumetric flask, dilute
to volume with methanol. Retain sufficient quantity of the same methanol for
the blank determination. Keep the solution in tightly closed
containers.(v)Procedure. - (a) Determination of end point in karl fischer
titration. - In many cases the end point can be detected by the change of
colour from a light brownish yellow to amber. But when the end point is not
clearly defined, the electrometric method for determining the end point should
be adopted. Adjust the potentiometer so that when a small excess (0.02 ml) of
the reagent is present, a current of 50 to 150 microampers is recorded : The
solution should be continuously and vigorously stirred. At the beginning of
the titration, a current of only a few microampers will flow. After each
addition of reagent, the pointer of the micrometer deflected but rapidly
returns to the original position. At the end point a deflection is obtained
which endures for a longer period.(b)Standardization of the fischer reagent. -
Pipette exactly 10 ml. of methanol into a dry titration flask and titrate with
the Fischer reagent to the end point (V1). Pipette exactly 10 ml. of the
standard water solution into the flask and titrate to the end point
(V2).(c)Titration of the material. - Transfer 25 ml. of methanol to the
titration flask and titrate to the end point (V3) with the Fischer reagent. Do
not record the volume consumed. Quickly transfer to the titrated liquid an
accurately weighed quantity of the material containing 10 to 50 mg. of water,
stir vigorously and titrate to the end point.Calculation

### 3\. Determination of nitrogen :

Methods of determination of total nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrate
nitrogen and urea nitrogen have been described separately in this section.
These methods can be adopted both for straight and mixed fertilisers. Scope of
each method with various combinations have also been described with each
method.The relevant method of analysis which have been described are as given

present junction shows at first purple, afterward brown, or if only minute
quantity is present. reddish colour.(e)To another portion of solution add 1
ml. 1 per cent NaNO3 and test as before to determine whether enough H2SO4 was
added in the first test.(Reference "Methods of Analysis" AOAC,
1965)(ii)Reagents for determination of total nitrogen(a)Sulphuric acid - 93 -
98 per cent H2SO4, N free.(b)Copper sulphate - CuSO45H2O reagent grade, N

may be used depending upon the availability of reagent, and suitability of the
method.(i)Perchloric acid method(This method depends on the insolubility of
potassium perchlorate and the solubility of sodium perchlorate in alcohol and
is applicable in presence of alkali metals chlorides and nitrates. Sulphates
and ammonium salts must be absent on account of the low solubility of sodium
sulphate of ammonium perchlorate in alcohol. Phosphates must be removed.
Method are given for the elimination of the effect of interfering
substances).(a)Reagents :(1)Concentrated hydrocloric acid.(2)Barium chloride
solution. Dissolve 100 gms. of barium chloride in water ; filter, the solution

aqueous solution.(8)20 per cent perchloric acid solution.(9)Alcohol -
industrial methylated spirit 95 - 96 per cent V/V.(10)Wash solution - add
potassium perchlorate to alcohol and shake until saturated solution is
obtained. Keep the solution over solid potassium perchlorate and filter
immediately before use.(b)Potassium salts free from sulphates and other
interfering substances. -(1)Dissolve in water a portion of the sample weighed
to the nearest mg. equivalent to potassium content to 1.5 to 2.0 gms. of
potash.(2)Cool the solution to 20C, dilute to 500 ml. in a volumetric flask,

solution by precipitating with perchloric acid as described under
procedure.(c)Potassium salts with sulphates or other interfering substances.
-(The following method is given by eliminating the interference caused by
presence of sulphate. If salts contain phosphates, iron, manganese or
substances other than sulphate that interfere with the determination of
potash, the method described for mixed fertiliser should be used).(1)Weigh to
the nearest mg. a portion of the sample equivalent in potassium content to 1.5
to 2.0 gms. of potash, into a 50 ml. beaker. Add about 300 ml. of water and 20

an hour with frequent stirring.(6)Cool to 20C, transfer to a 500 ml.
volumetric flask, dilute to 500 ml. and after thoroughly shaking filter
through a dry filter paper.(7)Transfer 250 ml. of the filtrate to another 500
ml. volumetric flask, make just acid with hydrochloric acid and heat to
boiling point.(8)To the boiling solution cautiously add drop by drop, barium
chloride solution until there is no further precipitation of barium
sulphate.(9)Render the contents of the flask alkaline with ammonium hydroxide
solution and precipitate the calcium and any excess of barium by adding
ammonium carbonate solution until no further visible precipitation occurs
followed by the addition of about 1 ml. of ammonium oxalate solution.(10)Cool
to 20C, dilute with water to 500 ml. and after thoroughly shaking, filter
through a dry filter paper.(11)Measure 100 ml. of the filtrate and evaporate
to dryness in a basin. Expel the ammonium salts from the residue by gently
heating the basic over a low flame, being careful to keep the temperature
below that of faint redness.(12)Cool the residue, moisten with concentrated
hydrochloric acid and again evaporate to dryness.(13)Take up the residue with
water the filter if necessary.(14)Determine the potash in the solution by
precipitation with perchloric acids described under procedure.(e)Procedure

basin as completely as possible.(8)Redissolve the precipitate on the paper and
that remaining in the basin with hot water.(9)Add 2 ml. of perchloric acid
solution to the combined solution and evaporate the whole down to the fuming
stage.(10)Cool the residue in the basin and thoroughly stir the contents with
20 ml. of alcohol.(11)Allow the precipitate to cool and settle and pour the
clear liquid through a weighed gooch or sintered glass crucible, draining the
precipatate as completely as possible from the liquid before adding 5 ml. of
wash solution.(12)Wash the precipitate by decantation with several similar
small portions of the wash solution, pouring the washing through the
crucible.(13)Transfer the precipitate to the crucible and wash it well with
the wash solution until free from acid.(14)Dry the precipitate at 100C and

### 6\. Method of analysis of anhydrous ammonia -

(i)Estimation of Water and Ammonia(a)Scoop : - This method is for the
determination of water at 20"C (or room temperature), and usually ammonia by
difference of any essentially anhydrous ammonia liquid product. Normally, the
water will be low (less than 0.5 per cent) or sample of synthetic
ammonia.(b)Apparatus :(1)Ammonia sampling tubes.(2)Fume hood with exhaust
dust.(3)Sample tube holder rack in hood fabricated as convenient to hold
number of tubes desired.(4)Gloves protective, elbow length.(c)Reagents
:Charcoal, reagent, 14 - 20 mesh.(d)Procedure, -(1)Remove the sample tubes
from the sample carrier and place in the provided sample tube holders in the
fume hood.(2)Allow the ammonia sample to boil and to evaporate (approximately
30 minutes) spontaneously in the fume hood. Because of the low temperature of
the boiling ammonia, atmospheric moisture freezes on the sample container.
Exercise care to see that one of this ice contaminates the sample.(3)When the
boiling of the sample ceases, remove the tube from the holder. Wipe the outer
surface of the tube dry and read and record the volume of liquid residue in
the tube.(4)From the volume recorded, calculate the weight per cent water in
the sample. Ignore the small piece of charcoal, if used.Calculation :

per cent water = |  A x F x 0.890 x 0.684__________________Vx 0.682 | x 100  
---|---|---  
  
whereA = volume of residue in tube (ml.)V = Volume of sample taken (m1.)F =
Evaporation factor, taken from Table I corresponding to noted sample pressure
when sampling was obtained.0.890= density of residue (gm./ml.)0.684= weight
fraction of water in residue.0.682= density of sample (gm./ml.)(e)Precaution.
-The evaporation in the fume hood should be conducted with the window lowered
to protect personnel from possible spray. Whenever it is necessary to handle
the sample tubes, protective gloves should be worn.Note. - Determination of
residue on evaporation will not usually be necessary for normal ammonia
sample. If sample is clear and water residue is clear and colourless, the
residue may be considered to be nil. However, should it become necessary to
determine the dissolved solids and suspended solids in anhydrous ammonia,
proceed as follows :(f)Sampling. -Thoroughly clean and dry the sample tubes,
weigh (W1) each selected tube to the nearest milligram with a similar tube as
counterpoise. Obtain the samples as desired earlier.(g)Apparatus.
-(1)Analytical balance.(2)Ammonia sampling tubes.(3)Rubber tubing, 1/4 OD
length desired.(h)Reagents :Air dry, carbon dioxide - free.(i)Procedure.
-(1)Start test following elimination of the water content of the sample as
given earlier.(2)Connect one end of a rubber hose to a source of dry, carbon
dioxide - free air. Insert the other end of the hose into the sample tube and
gently force air through the sample tube until all liquid has been evaporated
and no ammonia gas remains in the tube.(3)Wipe a counterpoise and the sample
tube containing the residue to substantially the same extent to remove
moisture which may have condensed on their outer surfaces.(4)Weigh the sample
tube and residue to nearest milligram.(5)Calculate the weight per cent residue
of the sample.Calculation :

Per cent residue = |  (W2- W1) x F x 100___________________Vx 0.682  
---|---  
  
WhereW1 = weight (gm.) of tube (before sampling).W2 = weight (gm.) of tube and
residue.V = volume of sample taken (m1.)F = Evaporation factor, taken from
Table 1 corresponding to noted sample pressure when sample was
obtained.0.682density of sample (gm./m1.)(j)Precaution. -A check of
completeness of evaporation may be made by visual inspection and by carefully
smelling the air in the tube making sure that no carbon dioxide or moisture
from the breath enters the sample tube.(k)Per cent ammonia content (by
difference) -In general, the ammonia content of the sample will : per cent
ammonia = 100 - (Per cent water - per cent residue, if
determined).(l)Precaution. -The evaporation in the fume hood should be
conducted with the window lowered to protect personnel from possible spray.
Whenever it is necessary to handle the sample tubes, protective gloves should
be worn.(ii)Determination of oil content(a)Apparatus :(1)500 ml. conical flask
calibrated to hold 300 ml. (about 200 gms.) of sample and with a bunk fitted
with glass through which the exist gas can be led away to a safe place. Ensure
that the glass tube and exist line are free from constructions.(2)Platinum
dish 75 mm. in diameter.(b)Reagent :The reagent used shall be of a recognised
analytical reagent quality like petroleum spirit with a boiling range of 40C
to 60C.(c)Procedure. -(1)Quickly running the sample (as per the sample
procedure) up to the calibration mark, insert the bunk.(2)Immerse the flask in
a continuous stream of cold water and allow the ammonia to evaporate
slowly.(3)When the evaporation is complete, remove the bunk and gently blow
out the last faces of ammonia with a small jet of filtered air free from
carbon dioxide.(4)Dry the outside of the flask.(5)Place the flask in an oven
at 1055C for 15 minutes to remove the moisture blowing out the last traces
with a gentle stream of filtered air at the end of this period ; allow to
cool.(6)Add to the flask approximately 100 ml. of the petroleum spirit and
swirl to dissolve the oil.(7)Filter the solution through a small filter paper
(a Whatman No. 31 paper is suitable) direct into the platinum dish previously
traced to the nearest 0.1 mg.(8)Repeat the operation with two more successive
10 ml. portions of petroleum spirit, filtering through the same paper as
before into the same dish.(9)Evaporate the combined extracts to dryness on a

Note. - When a sample of liquid ammonia is transferred to an open flask/tube
from a container in which the pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure
that sample quickly reaches the thermodynamics equilibrium with its new
environment. Some of the liquid ammonia will evaporate and since the ammonia
so lost as vapour contains non - volatile constituents present in the original
product, the concentration of these constituents will increase in the liquid
sample taken. This may be significant factor in subsequent analysis and
fortunately it is possible to calculate from the known thermodynamic
properties of ammonia an appropriate correction. This correction is usually
known in this context at the evaporation factor of flask factor and is simply
that fraction by weight of the original liquid ammonia which remains as liquid
in the sample Multiplication of the determined quantity of a non - volatile
constituents (oil, water dissolved or suspended solids, etc.) by the
evaporation factor gives a result which will be closer to the true figure. The
Table above presents the evaporation factor for different vessel or line
pressure.When a sample is transferred (example by gravity) from a container of
a cylinder or the sampler at the same pressure, there should be no loss by
evaporation and in this case it is not necessary to use evaporation factor :

to prevent rapid fading of developed colour. Add 10 ml. of sodium
diethyldithiocarbamete solution and develop the colour. Extract the coloured
complex with 5 - 10 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. Separate the carbon
tetrachloride layer from aqueous layer and centrifuge for 5 minutes to
separate the water droplets. Transfer the carbon tetrachloride solution to a
photometric cell and measure its absorbance at the wavelength of maximum
absorption 440 mu relative to reagent blank. Calculate the corrected
absorbance by subtracting the reading obtained for the solution containing -

this solution to 100 ml. with carbon tetrachloride in a 100 ml. volumetric
flask. This shall be prepared fresh before determination. This gives a
solution of 0.001 per cent.Note 1. - Carbon tetrachloride used should be
further purified. One litre of carbon tetrachloride is extracted with two
portions of 25 ml. dilute ammonium hydroxide and then kept over 100 gms. to
activated carbon. Before use, it is decanted and distilled at about 80C over
a little fresh lime.Note 2 - Sometimes dithzone solid and its 0.01 per cent
solution deteriorate on storage. The 0.01 per cent solution should, therefore,
be tested before further dilution, by shaking 2 ml. of the solution with 5 ml.
of 1 per cent ammonium hydroxide. If the organic layer is only faintly yellow
under these conditions, the solution may be used. If it is deeply coloured it
shall be discarded and fresh solution be prepared. The solution as well as the
reagent should be stored in a refrigerator and exposure to sunlight should be
avoided during analytical work. To increase the stability of 0.01 per cent
solution, it should be covered with a thin aqueous layer saturated with sulpur

with thiocyanate ion, probably largely Mo (SCN)5, which is red in colour. The
latter may be extracted with solvents possessing donor oxygen atoms (3 -
Methylbutanol is preferred). The colour depends upon the acid concentration
(optimum concentration 1M) and the concentration of thiocyanate ion (K 1.0 per
cent but colour intensity is constant in the range 2 - 10 per cent); it is;
little influenced, by excess of stannous chloride. The molybdenum complex has
