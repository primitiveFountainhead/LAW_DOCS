obstruction. Once cab signals show a proceed indication, Coded Manual mode
shall be automatically resumed and must be maintained as far as the next
station and if the train is equipped with Automatic Train Operation, then this
mode may be resumed at the next station.(4)If any point indication is missing
or shows the points set for the wrong direction, or there is a discrepancy
between the indications at the station and in Operations Control Centre, the

## Chapter VIII  
Systems of Working

### 55. Continuous Automatic Train Control System.

(1)The Continuous Automatic Train Control system of working shall be adopted
on Bangalore Metro Railway for movement of trains between stations and between
depot and the main line.(2)The Continuous Automatic Train Control system works
on the principle of target speed and target distance with cab signaling by
means of continuous transmission from track to train through track circuits,
ensuring safe movement of all trains under all operating conditions by
continuously generating a safe operating envelope defined by the limit of
movement authority and the maximum safe speed.(3)The limit of movement
authority shall be the farthest point to which the train may safely proceed
taking into account margins for error in speed and distance measurement,
calculating braking distances and the equipment reaction times.(4)The maximum
safe speed shall be maximum speed at which the train is permitted to travel
without intervention by the train control and signaling system and it shall be
continuously calculated in such a manner that permanent speed restrictions,
the speed limits for the type of train and temporary speed restrictions shall
not be exceeded and the train shall always stop without passing the limit of
movement authority.(5)The Continuous Automatic Train Control system shall
provide the following modes of train operation, namely:-(a)Automatic
mode;(b)Coded Manual mode(c)Run on Sight mode;(d)Restricted Manual mode;
and(e)Cut out mode.

### 56. Automatic mode.

(1)In the Automatic mode, the train shall operate without intervention by the
Train Operator except closing of train doors and starting from a station. The
Automatic mode shall operate under the supervision and control of Automatic
Train Protection functions.(2)In Automatic mode, the train control and the
signalling system shall-(a)accelerate and decelerate the train by applying
traction power, coasting and applying and releasing brakes;(b)automatically
control speed, acceleration, stopping and starting the train at
stations;(c)provide all indications necessary to operate the
train;(d)determine continuously the maximum safe speed and limit of movement
authority;(e)prevent movement of the train in excess of the maximum safe speed
and limit of movement authority(f)open train doors on the correct side when
the train is docked if permitted by the Automatic Train Protection door
release and the platform screen doors on the correct side open automatically,
if provided;(g)prevent the train from starting if the train doors are not
detected closed;(h)train re-starting from a signal stop shall be automatic;
and(i)train starting or re-starting from a station stop shall be initiated by
the train operator.

### 57. Coded Manual mode.

(1)In Coded manual mode the train shall be driven by the Train Operator,
obeying cab signals.(2)In Coded Manual mode, the Train Control and Signaling
system shall-(a)provide cab signals and all other indications necessary to
operate the train including current speed;(b)determine continuously the
maximum safe speed and limit of movement authority;(c)prevent train operation
in excess of maximum safe speed or limit of movement authority;(d)provide
audible and visible warning if the train speed exceeds the maximum safe
speed;(e)enable train doors when the train is docked, enabling only the doors
on the platform side of the train to be open; and(f)prevent the train from
starting, if the train doors are not detected closed.

### 58. Run on Sight mode.

\- In Run on Sight mode, which only operates in the absence of Automatic Train
Protection signals from the track, the train is driven manually on line of
sight and the speed is limited by Automatic Train Protection system to a
maximum of 25km/hr. When Automatic Train Protection signals from track are
received, this mode automatically changes to Coded Manual mode.

### 59. Restricted Manual mode.

(1)The Restricted manual mode is the default mode of operation and is
automatically initiated, when the automatic train control train borne
equipment is first powered. It remains in operation until sufficient
conditions have been met to allow for a transfer to Coded Manual mode.(2)The
Restricted Manual mode shall be used--(a)to operate trains in
depots;(b)following an emergency brake application on main line, and absence
of cab signals;(c)for entry to the depot; and(d)On instructions from Traffic
Controller.(3)In Restricted Manual mode, the train speed shall be limited to a
maximum of twenty five kilometer per hour enforced by on board Automatic Train
Protection equipment.(4)The Train doors on the correct side will also have to
be operated manually by the train operator.

### 60. Cut - Out Mode.

(1)The "Cut out" mode, is intended for use in case of complete train borne
train control and signaling system failure and in such mode the train speed
shall be restricted to 25 km/hr enforced by on board rolling stock
equipment.(2)In Cut Out mode, the train shall be operated by the Train
Operator in accordance with line side signals and on Radio verbal instructions
from the Traffic Controller.(3)Running of trains on mainline in Cut Out mode
is permitted only under instructions of the Traffic Controller.(4)The train
doors on the correct side shall also have to be operated manually by the train
operator.

## Chapter IX  
Single Line Working

### 61. Objective of single line working.

'fleeting' of trains in groups in one direction at intervals decided by the
traffic controller fOllowed by an equivalent group of trains in the other
direction.

### 62. Implementation.

(1)The Traffic Controller, shall after consultation with the Chief Controller,
decide to implement the single line working.(2)The Traffic Controller, shall
before the train passes in the reverse direction, inform to the Station

Controllers shall also closely monitor crowding on the platform in use and
prepare to close entrances to the station if overcrowding becomes
dangerous.(4)The Station Controllers at these stations shall inform passengers
by visual and audible announcements and take any other measures necessary to
direct passengers on the correct platform.(5)The Traffic Controller shall
inform the Train Operators of all trains of the location and direction of the
single line working.(6)Trains shall work under normal signaling including
Automatic Train Operation, but on lines equipped with Automatic Train
Operation, Automatic Train Operation control shall be available in the normal
direction of travel only, in the reverse direction, the train shall be driven
under Manual Cab Signal mode.(7)When normal working is to be restored, the
Traffic Controller shall inform the Station Controller of each station at the
single line section of the last train to pass the section in the reverse
direction after which normal station operation shall be restored.

### 63. Signaling Failures.

\- In the event of a failure of a track side signaling equipment which makes
Restricted Manual operation necessary on all trains, single line working shall
be suspended immediately and if necessary, train may still pass through the
section in the normal direction of travel and after defect is repaired; single
line working may be resumed.
