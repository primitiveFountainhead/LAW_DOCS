The Industrial Development Bank Of India Act, 1964(18 OF 1964)

### 13.

/615Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The existing arrangements for the
provision of credit for the expansion or development of industry are not
adequate in relation to the needs of the various enterprises or projects. It
is proposed, therefore, to establish a new institution, to be known as the
Industrial Development Bank of India. It will be wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Reserve Bank of India and will be managed by a Board of Directors
consisting of persons who are for the time being the members of the Central
Board of the Reserve Bank.2\. The Industrial Development Bank of India will be
able to co-ordinate the activities of all the institutions which are or may be
concerned with the provision of finance for industrial development. It will be
in a position to provide refinance to these institutions or to grant direct
loans to industrial concerns or to promote and develop key industries, as
circumstances may require.3\. The provisions of the Bill are explained in
detail in the notes on clauses.-S.O.R. Gazette of India, 27-2-1964, Pt, II,
section 2, extra. Page 60.Amending Act No. 75 of 1972 - Statement of Objects
and Reasons - It has been found from experience gained by the Industrial
Development Bank of India in its working, since its establishment in 1964,
that it is necessary to amend the Act in certain respects.2\. The definition
of 'industrial concern under section 2(c) of the Act is proposed to be
enlarged to include establishments engaged in maintenance and repairs of
vehicles as well as concerns engaged in fishing or in the maintenance of shore
facilities for fishing, so as to enable the Industrial Development Bank of
India to play its role effectively in all fields as an apex institution for
financing and refinancing other institutions.3\. Section 9 of the Act dealing
with the scope of the business of the Development Bank is proposed to be
enlarged in several respects. The Development Bank, at present, refinances
loans and advances granted by the Industrial Finance Corporation of India,
State Financial Corporations, Scheduled Banks and State Co-operative Banks to
industrial concerns. Since some of these institutions give loans and advances
for the establishment of industrial estates also but are unable to do so
adequately from within their own limited resources, it is proposed to
authorize the Development Bank to refinance these institutions in relation to
such activities.4\. At present the Development Bank is empowered to refinance
loans given by the State Financial Corporations, the Industrial Finance
Corporation of India, the commercial banks and the co-operative banks for the
export of machinery and merchandise. It is now proposed to extend these
facilities of refinance to the institutions financing the agencies exporting
manufactured capital goods and to the concerns or persons in India executing
turn-key jobs in foreign countries. The refinancing facilities extended by the
Development Bank are now restricted to the cases where the primary lending
institution advances loans repayable within a period of ten years in all
cases. It is now proposed to liberalise this provision to cases where the
primary lending institutions grant loans to persons in India repayable within
a period of 15 years and to persons outside India repayable within a period of
12 years.5\. The Development Bank can now accept, discount or rediscount bills
of exchange and promissory notes of industrial concerns only. It is proposed
to extend this facility to stockiest or agents who sell plant and machinery of
manufacturing concerns. The Act enables the Development Bank to subscribe, to
shares and debentures of the Industrial Finance Corporation of India, the
State Financial Corporations and any other financial institutions notified by
the Central Government in this behalf. It is now proposed to enlarge the power
so as to enable the Development Bank to participate in the share capital of
notified financial institutions promoted outside India as well.6\. In the
field of exports, it is now proposed to enable the Development Bank to grant
loans and advances to any persons exporting products of industrial concerns or
to any person outside India in connection with the export of capital goods
from India, or for the execution of turn-key projects, outside India by any
industrial concern or by any person in India. Financial assistance will
therefore be available to parties outside India for importing capital goods
from India and also for any activity in connection with it. The Development
Bank is also being authorized to perform certain agency functions.7\. By a new
section 9A, it is proposed to prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, the
Development Bank from granting assistance to industrial concerns in which any
director of the Development Bank may be having a beneficial interest. The
Development Bank is the only institution capable of financing very large
projects in the core and heavy investment sectors. It is, therefore, provided
that the prohibition may be relaxed in cases where the Development Bank is
satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest to finance such an
industrial concern if the assistance is given subject to such conditions and
limitations as may be prescribed by the Development Bank with the prior
approval of the Reserve Bank of India.8\. It is considered necessary to effect
certain liberalisation in regard to the liability arising out of fluctuations
in the rate of exchange during the period of repayment of the foreign currency
loans borrowed by the Development Bank from foreign lending agencies. At
present the liability arising out of fluctuations in foreign exchange is
completely borne by the borrowing industrial concerns. It is now proposed that
it need be borne by the borrowers only so long as they have not discharged
their liability completely to the Development Bank. After that period the
Development Bank will bear the losses arising out of the normal market
fluctuations in foreign exchange and the Central Government will bear the
losses in respect of fluctuations, such as devaluation of Indian currency or
revaluation of foreign currency as may be adverse to Indian currency. Any
profit arising from fluctuations in favour of Indian currency is also proposed
to be similarly dealt with.9\. The Development Bank normally reserves the
power to nominate one or more directors on the Boards of assisted concerns.
The new section 30A is intended to enable the Development Bank to exercise the
power effectively.10\. The Bill seeks to achieve these main objects.
Opportunity has also been taken to incorporate some other amendments which are
found necessary for the smooth working of the Development Bank and are of a
consequential or procedural nature. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill
explain the position thereof.-Gazette. of India., 8-12-72, Pt. II, section 2,
Ext., p. 1544.-.Amending Act No. 52 of 1975 - Statement of Objects and Reasons
- It is proposed to restructure the Industrial Development Bank of India in
certain respects, so as to enlarge its role as the principal financial
institution financing industry and for coordinating the working of other
financial institutions engaged in the financing or promotion or development of
industry. The financial institutions, in this context, include the Industrial
Finance Corporation of India, the Life Insurance Corporation of India, the
Unit Trust of India, the Industrial Reconstruction Corporation of India
Limited, the State Financial Corporations, all in the public sector, the
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited, in the private
sector and such other institutions as may be notified by the Central
Government in this behalf. Besides these, the State Bank of India, its seven
subsidiary banks, the fourteen nationalised banks, scheduled banks and the
State Co-operative Banks are also proposed to be brought within the purview of
co ordination by the Development Bank as these institutions participate with
the Development Bank and other term lending institutions in financing
industry.2\. The Development Bank is at present a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Reserve Bank of India; the Directors on the Central Board of the Reserve
Bank constitute the Board of Directors of the Development Bank. It is now
proposed to transfer the entire capital of the Development Bank held by the
Reserve bank to the Central Government. There will also be a separate Board of
Directors for the Development Bank on which the financial institutions and the
public sector banks will be represented.

### 3. In view of the enlarged role envisaged for the Development Bank, it is
proposed that it should take over the capital held by the Reserve Bank in the
different State Financial Corporations and in the Unit Trust of India. Since
the Life Insurance Corporation is already wholly owned by the Central
Government, no restructuring of its capital is envisaged. 50 per cent of the
share capital of the Industrial Reconstruction Corporation of India Limited
and the Industrial Finance Corporation of India are already held by the
Development Bank. The Development Bank does not propose to hold any share
capital in the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
as it is an institution in the private sector. The corporation is, however,
being represented on the Board of Directors of Development Bank along with the
other institutions and public sector banks so as to facilitate co-ordinate
functioning.

4\. With the Development Bank assuming the role of the principal financial
institution, it is proposed to have representatives of the Development Bank on
the Boards of other institutions, wherever considered necessary or
feasible.5.To give effect to the above, amendments are proposed to the
Industrial Development Bank of India Act, 1964, Reserve Bank of India Act,
1934, Industrial Finance Corporation Act, 1948, State Finance Corporations
Act, 1951, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956and Unit Trust of India Act,
1963.6\. Opportunity has also been taken to streamline other provisions of the
different statutes and to propose certain amendments of a clarificatory
nature.7\. The notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions
contained in the Bill.See Gazette of India, 22-12-1973, Point II ,Section
2,Ext.,p.1183.Amendment Act 73 of 1976 - Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Itis proposed to bring about a measure of uniformity in the procedure for
appointment, fixation of the terms and conditions of service including removal
from, or termination of, service of the chairman, vice-chairman, and managing
directors of the State Bank of India, chairmen of the Regional Rural Banks,
chairman of the Industrial Finance Corporation of India and chairman and
managing director of the Industrial Development Bank of India in the relevant
enactments regulating the said institutions. These Executives will also have
the option to relinquish office by giving the Central Government notice of
three months. It is proposed to make the amendments applicable to the existing
incumbents of these offices also. :2\. Opportunity has also been taken to
streamline some other provisions of these Statutes.SOR- See Gazette of India
.24-5-76, Point II, section 2, Ext., page 939.Amendment Act 35 of 1986.-
Statement of Objects and Reasons - The Industrial Development Bank of India
(the Development Bank) established under the industrial Development Bank of
India Act, 1964 is the principal financial institution for providing credit
and other facilities for the development of industry, for coordinating the
working of institutionsengaged in financing, promoting or developing
industries and for assisting the development of such institutons. The
Development Bank has been providing direct financial assistance to large and
medium large industrial concerns and also providing help to small and medium
industrial concerns through banks and state-level financial institution. In
the light of experience gained over the years, it is felt necessary to make
some new activities also eligible for financial assistance and to enlarge t he
scope of business of the Development Bank to cover certain activities which
the Development Bank could not take up in the absence of enabling provisions.
It is also felt necessary to enlarge the capital base so as to enable the
Development Bank to cater to the growing volume of business. It is also
proposed to provide more operational flexibility to the Development Bank to
enable it to discharge more effectively its functions as the principal
financial institution for the development of industries.2\. The main proposals
are as follows: (a) The present definition of "industrial concern" as
contained in the Act does not include many important activities. It is,
therefore, proposed to widen the definition of "industrial concern" so as to
enable the Development Bank to provide financial assistance of mines, medical,
health or allied services, leasing and sub-leasing activities, information
technology, telecommunicatons and electronics. It is also proposed to empower
the Central Government to bring within the purview of the definition
"industrial concern" engaged in activities which may be found to be support
worthy. (b) In view of the expanding volume of its business and the expected
growth if in the Development Bank's activities, it is proposed to raise the
authorised capital of the Bank from Rs. 500to Rs. 1,000 crores which limit may
be increased by the Central Government up to Rs.2,000 crores by notification
in the .official Gazette. (c) It is proposed to enlarge the scope of business
which the Development Bank can undertake by empowering it to grant lives of
credit or loans and advances, otherwise than by way of subscription to
shares/debentures to Industrial Finance Corporation of India, State Financial
Corporations or any other financial institutions notified by the Central
Government, to grant loans and advances to any person for purpose of
investment in any industrial project to open and advise letters of credit and
to negotiate or collect, bills and other documents drawn there under, to
provide consultancy and merchant banking services in or outside India, to act
as trustee for the holders of debentures and other securities and to provide
for acquisition of business and undertaking of any other financial
institution. In view of these amendments, the Development Bank will be able to
undertake these activities and discharge its role as the principal financial
institution. (d) It is proposed to amend the Act to enable the Development
Bank to open offices even a the place where it has its head office. (e) A new
provision is sought to be inserted to enable the Development Bank to purchase
the participation certificates under the participation certificate scheme
operated by IDBI, IFIC and ICICI providing for a single window clearance of
the proposals for setting up an industrial unit, and speedy availability of
funds for the project. (f) Presently, the directors nominated by the Central
Government from amongst the employees of the Development Bank and financial
institutions and persons having special skills and experience, hold office
during the pleasure of the Central Government. It is proposed to provide that
such members shall hold office for such term not exceeding three years as the
Central Government may specify, (g) The acccountig year of the Development
Bank at present is from 1st July to 30th June. It is proposed to amend the Act
to provide flexibility to the Development Bank to change the accounting year,
if need be,3\. It is also proposed to make certain other minor and
consequential amendments in the Act.4\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
objects. -Gazette of India , 20-12-85, Point II, section 2, Ext., page 5 (.No.
