Kanyakumari Sreepandaravaka Lands (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari)
Act, 1964(Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1964)Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Kanyakumari Sreepandaravaka Lands (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari)
Act, 1964 (Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1964). - In the Kanyakumari district,
transferred to this State from the former State of Travancore-Cochin by the
States Reorganisation Act, 1956 (Central Act 37 of 1956), there are certain
lands called Sreepandaravaka lands which belong to the Sree Padmanabhaswami
Temple at Trivandrum. The lands are not assessed to basic tax but are assessed
to a favourable assessment called Rajabhogam. In addition to the Rajabhogam
payable to the Government, the tenants holding the lands pay rent, both in
kind and in cash, to Sree Padmanabhaswami Temple. The Government have decided
that the tenants of these lands should be received of their liability to pay
rent to the Temple, that the lands should be converted into ryotwari subject
to payment of ryotwari assessment to the Government and that the Government
should suitably compensate the Temple for the loss of its rental income from
the lands. This Bill seeks to give effect to this decision.2\. The provisions
of the Bill are explained in the Notes on Clauses.Published in Part IV-Section
4, page 90 of the Fort St. George Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 25th March
1964; for report of the Select Committee, see Part IV-Section 3, pages 205-224
of the Fort St. George Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 17th July
1964.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu (Transferred Territory)
Thiruppuvaram Payment Abolition Act, 1964 (Tamil Nadu Act 32 of 1964). - In
the Kanyakumari district and the Shencottah taluk of the Tirunelveli district,
which district and taluk were transferred to this State from the former State
of Travancore-Cochin by the States Reorganization Act, 1956 (Central Act 37 of
1956), thiruppuvaram is payable in respect of certain lands. Thiruppuvaram is
an assignment of revenue or of rent, payable in money or in kind or in both,
made in favour of any religious, educational or charitable institution, or
individual and recognized by customary law as thiruppuvaram or entered as such
in the revenue accounts. According to section 9 of the Travancore-Cochin Land
Tax Act, 1955 (Travancore-Cochin Act XV of 1955), thiruppuvaram is payable by
the landholder in addition to the basic lax due to the Government. After the
proposed ryotwari settlement of the transferred territory, it would be
unreasonable to insist on the payment of thiruppuvaram in addition to the
ryotwari assessment. The Government have, therefore, decided that the
landholders should be relieved of the liability to pay thiruppuvaram and that
the Government should suitably compensate the thiruppuholders for the loss of
their income from thiruppuvaram. This Bill seeks to give effect to this
decision.2\. The provisions of the Bill are explained in the Notes on
Clauses.Published in Part IV-Section 3 of the Fort St. George Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 26th March 1964, page 111.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Third
Amendment) Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 50 of 1974). - The Kanyakumari Devaswom
Board was constituted after the reorganisation of States as per the Tamil Nadu
(Transferred Territory) Incorporated and Unincorporated Devaswoms Act, 1959
(Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1959) for the administration, supervision and control
over the Incorporated and Unincorporated Devaswoms and all their properties
and funds, in the transferred territory, namely, the Kanyakumari district and
the Shencottah taluk of the Tirunelveli district. There are four hundred and
fifty eight Incorporated and thirty-two Unincorporated Devaswoms in the
transferred territory. The Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments has reported that there is no co-operation among the members of the
Board and that as a result of this, the management of the Devaswoms suffers.
The Government have now decided that the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) be extended to the
transferred territory with a provision for the appointment of a single Board
of Trustees consisting of not more than five members for the administration of
the Devaswoms in the transferred territory and their properties and funds.2\.
It is proposed to make provision in the Act for the appropriation of surplus
funds of the religious institutions, also for the performance of Hindu
marriages among Hindus who are poor or in needy circumstances, in addition to
the purposes mentioned in section 36.3\. The Government have decided to
appoint executive officers for the temples under the control of maths and that
such executive officers should be under the control of the trustees of the
maths.4\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.Published in Part IV-
