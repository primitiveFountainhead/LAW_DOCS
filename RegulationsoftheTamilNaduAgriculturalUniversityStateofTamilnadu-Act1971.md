### 3\. The following general principles and conditions apply to these
advances.

### 4\. As a general rule, no advance shall be granted to any University
employee unless he is in permanent service since the pay of a non-permanent
University employee is not adequate security for the repayment of an advance.
The University may, however, sanction an advance to an officiating or
temporary University employee who is an approved probationer in service and is
not likely, so far as can be foreseen at the time, to be ousted subject to the
rules applicable to advances of that kind and to the following further
conditions. The form of application for advance to purchase a motorcar/cycle
is given in Form No. VIII (Appendix IV). The form of agreement to be executed
for this purpose is given in Form No. (ix) (Appendix IV)

### 5\. No such advances should be granted for the purchase of a conveyance
other than a motor car, motor cycle and bicycle, unless a personal security
bond is furnished in Form No. (x), (App. IV) duly executed by the borrower
together with a permanent University employee drawing a pay not less than that
of the borrower as surety guaranteeing the repayment of the advance.

### 6\. The number of monthly instalments by which repayments is to be made
should, when necessary with reference to all the circumstances including the
period for which the temporary post is sanctioned, be fixed at a suitable
number lower than the permissible maximum.

### 7\. The authority competent to sanction an advance to a permanent
University employee may also sanction such an advance to an officiating or
temporary University employee, subject to the conditions laid down above for
advances by the University to an officiating or temporary University employee.

### 8\. Interest: Simple interest should be charged at the rate fixed by the
Government of Tamil Nadu for similar advances to its employees, from time to
time.

### 9\. Repayment: The principal of an advance should be recovered in equal
monthly instalments by compulsory deductions from the pay of the borrowing
University employee, beginning with the first payment of a full month's pay
after the advance is drawn. The amount of monthly instalment other than the
lust should be fixed in whole rupees, and as the last instalment the remaining
balance including any fraction of a rupee should be recovered. The maximum
number of monthly instalments in which the sanctioning authority may permit
the principal of an advance of each kind to be repaid is as follows:-

| Amount of advance | Instalments of recovery  
---|---|---  
(a) | Purchase of new car:- |   
|  Rs. 20,000 or 20 months' pay of the employee or anticipatedprice of the new car whichever is less. For the purchase ofsecond hand cars Rs. 15,000 or 20 months' pay or purchase priceof the car whichever is less. |  70 instalments if it is Rs. 14,000 or less and 80 instalmentsif it is more than Rs. 14,000  
(b) |  For purchase of new motor cycle Rs. 3,000/- Second hand motorcycle Rs. 2,500 | 60 instalments  
(c) | For purchase of bicycle Rs. 200 | 36 instalments  
  
Note. - The price includes the expenditure on repairs and renewals on the
motor cars and the items which have necessarily to be purchased along with the
motor car e.g. spare wheel, tyre and tube, but does not include insurance and
registration charges and the cost of additional accessories, fittings, etc.
The time limit for carrying out repairs and renewals Is one month from the
date of purchase of the car. The stamped receipts for repairs and renewals
should be sent to the Vice-Chancellor through the Head of the Department and
Comptroller.

### 10\. When the pay or leave salary bill of a University employee for a
month is presented and drawn after due date for administrative reasons,
deductions made on account of repayment of an advance from such pay or leave
salary bills will be deemed to have been made in the month following the month
to which the pay or leave salary of the University employee relates
irrespective of the actual date of its drawal.

### 11\. The recovery of interest should begin with the pay of the next month
after the repayment of the principal is completed. The interest should be
calculated on the balance outstanding on the last day of each month. If the
total amount of interest to be charged does not appreciably exceed the amount
fixed for the equal monthly instalments for recovery of the principal, it
should be recovered in a single instalment; otherwise, it should be recovered
in instalments not appreciably exceeding that amount.

### 12\. Unless otherwise provided in the rules applicable to advances of a
particular kind, the amount of the monthly instalments to be recovered on
account of an advance should not be changed by reason of the borrowing
University employee's going on any kind of leave with leave salary or his
drawing subsistence grant. In special circumstances, the head of the
department may recommend that the University should reduce the monthly
instalments in a particular case for the duration of the period during which
the borrower does not draw pay. The whole amount due should, however, always
be completely recovered within the period originally fixed unless, for
exceptionally strong reasons, the University sanctions a special extension of
that period.

### 13\. If an advance is granted to a University employee who is due to
retire or whose services are likely to be terminated within the maximum period
prescribed for its repayment, the number of instalments shall be so regulated
that the repayment of the advance with interest, if any, is completed before
retirement, or termination of service, as the case may be. Where the death-
cum-retirement gratuity is applied for the repayment of any outstanding
advance, no interest should be charged in respect of the period beyond the
date of death of the University employee on the amount of advance thus
adjusted against the Death-cum-retirement gratuity.

### 14\. Procedure for sanction. - Every application for an advance should be
referred to the Comptroller for remarks as to whether funds are available and
whether the grant of the advance would involve any departure from the ordinary
rules. The amounts, if any, outstanding against the applicant on account of
advances of all kinds should be furnished by the concerned drawing officers.
The sanctioning authority should specify in the sanction order that the
advance should be drawn within a period of not more than one month later than
the date of sanction. The sanction order lapses, if the advance is not drawn
by the specified date.

### 15\. All drawing officers should intimate to the Comptroller promptly, all
cases where the applications for advances are rejected or withdrawn after his
certificate of availability of funds was obtained and where advance could not
be drawn within one month from the date of sanction order, so as to enable him
to increase the balance of the appropriation available for allotment to other
applicants for advances according to the priority list maintained by him.

### 16\. Advances for the purchase of motor cars. - These advances are
sanctioned subject to the following rules. The sanctioning authority is the
Vice-Chancellor, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore.

eligible for an advance on account of a motor car which he has already
acquired when he submits his application for an advance.(2)If an University
employee who has applied for an advance from the University has a favourable
opportunity of buying a suitable car, he may take delivery of it in payment;
of the whole or any portion of its purchase price, to be recouped later from
the advance already applied for, if and when the University sanctions
it.(3)When the University sanctions an advance to an University employee who
is on leave or is about to proceed on such leave, he is not allowed to draw it
earlier than a week before the expiry of his leave.(4)Notwithstanding anything
contained in this article, an University employee may be allowed to draw the
advance sanctioned to him at any time during the currency of leave, if he
receives intimation regarding the availability of the conveyance while he is
on leave. The recovery of advance in such cases, will however, commence with
the first issue of pay or leave salary after the advance is drawn.(5)No
advance is admissible to University employees for the purchase of a motor car
abroad, either while on leave or on deputation out of India.(6)An University
employee who travels in his old car when he goes on leave on condition that
the firm shall supply him with a new car on his return from leave, may soon
after taking delivery of the new car, apply for an advance not exceeding the
amount which he has actually paid in cash towards the price of the new
car.(7)Except when an University employee proceeds on leave other than leave
on average pay not exceeding four months, or retires from the service, or is
transferred to an appointment the duties of which do not render the possession
of motor car necessary, he may not, without the University's previous
sanction, sell a car purchased with the aid of an advance which, with the
interest on it has not been fully repaid. If an University employee wishes to
transfer such a car to another University employee who performs duties for
which a motor car is necessary, the University may permit the transfer of the
liability attaching to the car to the latter University employee, provided
that he records a declaration that he is aware that the car transferred to him
remains subject to the mortgage bond and that he is bound by its terms and
provisions.(8)Whenever an University employee sells a car before completing
the repayment of an advance received from the University for its purchase with
the interest on it, he should apply the sale proceeds, so far as may be
necessary, towards the repayment of the outstanding balance due to the
University. If however the borrower sells the car only in order to purchase
another car, the University may permit him to apply the sale-proceeds towards
the purchase, subject to the following conditions:-(i)If the amount
outstanding exceeds the cost of the new car, the University employee should
repay the excess to the University immediately.(ii)The University employee
should continue to repay the amount outstanding by the monthly instalments
already fixed.(iii)The new car should be insured and mortgaged to the
University as required by the rules.(9)Every University employee who applies
for an advance should forward with his application an agreement executed by
him in the prescribed form. If advance is granted, he should execute a
mortgage bond in the prescribed form after buying the car and should also
insure the car.

### 19\. Procedure: An University employee who is eligible for and requires an
advance should submit his application in Form No. (viii) (Appendix IV)

### 20\. An University employee who requires an advance for the purchase of a
motor car should submit with his application an agreement executed by him in
Form No. (ix) (Appendix IV). If the application and the agreement are in
order, the Head of the Department should certify accordingly and forward them
to the Vice-Chancellor of the University through the Comptroller who will
certify as to the availability of funds, etc. If, for any reason, the
sanctioning authority has to return the application or the agreement for
correction, the University employee should resubmit the revised application or
agreement to the Vice-Chancellor of the University through the Head of the
Department, who should certify as to its correctness and through the
Comptroller who will again certify as to the availability of funds. The period
of one month specified for the drawal of the advance runs from the date of
issue of sanction order.

### 21\. If the advance is sanctioned, the sanctioning authority should send
the Comptroller a certificate that the borrower has signed the agreement in
Form No. (ix) (Appendix IV) and that it has been examined and found to be in
order.

### 22\. An University employee who draws an advance should pay finally for,
and take delivery of, the car within one month from the date of drawing the
advance, otherwise he should repay the University at once the full amount of
the advance drawn with interest on it for one month. If he completes the
transaction within one month allowed, he should then immediately execute a
mortgage bond in Form (xi) (Appendix IV) hypothecating the car to the
University as the security for the advance. He should enter the actual price
paid for that car in the schedule attached to the bond. The sanctioning
authority should see that the borrower completes the transaction within the
time allowed or makes the necessary repayment immediately on its expiry. If he
duly completes the transactional time, the sanctioning authority should see
that he immediately submits the necessary mortgage bond duly executed and
should transmit it promptly to the Comptroller for scrutiny. It should, after
such scrutiny, be forwarded to the Vice-Chancellor of University for custody.

### 23\. The mortgage bond to be executed by an University employee who draws
an advance provides that he shall keep the car insured against loss or damage
by fire, theft, or accident. He should effect the necessary insurance within
one month from the date of purchase of the car. Insurance on owner-driven or
other similar qualified terms is not sufficient for the purpose of this rule,
but insurance at a reduced rate of premium in consideration of (i) the owner's
undertaking to meet the first Rs. 250 of any claim under the policy, or (ii)
the car's not being insured against accident for any season of the year during
which it is not in use, but is stored in a garage, should be accepted as
adequate.

### 24\. If the borrower fails to insure the car within the prescribed period,
he should refund the whole of the advance with the interest that has accrued
on it. The amount for which the car is insured during any period should not be
less than the outstanding balance of the advance with the interest that has
accrued at the beginning of that period, and the insurance should be renewed,
from time to time, until the amount due is completely repaid. If at any time,
the amount for which the car is actually insured is less than the outstanding
balance of the advance including the interest that has already accrued, the
University employee should refund the difference, to the University in not
more than three monthly instalments. In the case of insurance policies under
which the companies will be liable to pay only the market value or the insured
value of the car, whichever is less, the difference between the market value
and the outstanding advance against the officer, including interest should be
refunded by the officer ordinarily in three monthly instalments.

### 25\. On receipt of the sanctioning authority's certificate prescribed in
rule 21 above, the Comptroller will obtain from the borrower a letter in Form
55 to the Insurance Company with which the car is insured informing them that
the University' is interested in the insurance policy and will forward this
letter to the company with the necessary endorsement and obtain their
acknowledgment. The Comptroller should repeat the same procedure whenever the
policy is about to fall due for renewal, so long as any amount remains
outstanding on account of the advance. He should also require the borrower to
produce his receipt for the renewal premium on each such occasion before the
date on which the policy is due for renewal, and should scrutinize it to see

Advances to University Employees on Foreign Service

### 26\. When an University employee who is on foreign service require an
advance for the purchase of a motor car, he should apply to the foreign
employer to grant it from his funds. If the foreign employer wishes to grant
the advance, he should apply to the University for their sanction. If the
University accords its sanction, it will be subject to the proviso that the
advance by the foreign employer shall be regulated by the same conditions as
would apply to an advance by the University. If the foreign employer is not
willing to grant the advance, but recommends that the University should do so,
the University may, if it thinks fit, sanction the grant of the advance from
the University fund under these rules, provided that the University employee's
duties make a motor car practically a necessity for him.

for the purchase of books for the University Library

### 1\. Foreign Books. - The University Library will invite quotations for the
supply of foreign publications, annually, from the leading book-sellers in
India. The quotations thus received, will be tabulated to find out the nature
of the conversion rates for the foreign currencies adopted by the book trade
of India.

The University will, after studying the trends in the conversion rates
followed in the book trade of India, will evolve its own rates on the basis of
the quotations received. The rates so formulated in respect of the terms of
business, etc., will be circulated among the leading book-sellers who have
furnished their quotations to find out whether the University rates and terms
of business are agreeable to them. The replies received from the various book-
sellers will be processed and those book-sellers who agree to effect the
supply of foreign and Indian books under the University rules and terms of
business will be appointed as the agents of the University for the year.After
the appointment of the agents, the library will send the book selection lists
to all the above said approved agents for the year, to find out from them,
which are all the books that can be supplied by them, or which of them can be
procured either from India or abroad within the time required for the same.On
getting their replies, supply orders will be placed with each agent of the
books which he has agreed to supply or procure them for the University.In case
of more than one agent willing to supply one or more books, the discretion of
placing supply order will rest with the University.(a)University rates: The
University evolves its own conversion rates which will be advantageous for the
University, in the sense, that it can get all its requirements, since the
rates will act as an incentive to the book trade.The evolving of the
University rates permits the University to have elasticity in having more
number, of agents as the source of supply of its required publication than to
have one single agent, selected merely by his lowest quotation without judging
whether he could be in a position to effect all the supplies single handed. In
reality, it is seen that wherever single agents are selected then the supply
of the entire requirements are poor, since the agent will be ready to supply
only such of those publications wherein he can make some profit and not the
publication which will result him in a loss.The principle here is that the
Library has always the authority to accept lower prices by higher discount.
But it should not mean that the small margin in terms of discount should come
in the way of the growth of the Library and hinder the academic, research and
extension education programmes of the University.For the above said purpose, a
minimum of 10% discount will be adopted by the University in
general.(b)Exchange rate: The exchange rate for the Dollar and the Sterling
will be the prevailing market rate adopted by the book trade. For the European
and other currencies, the official exchange rate will be adopted by the
University.(c)Duration of supply period: The University will stipulate every
year the duration of supply period to the agents for the books ordered with
them.(d)Dealer-Library Plan: The University Library will enter into an
agreement with the leading publishers of the world through their
representative booksellers available in India, to mail their latest
publications directly. These books will be preferred to the Heads of
Departments for their opinion. If the book/books is/are not approved by the
University, it/they will be returned to the representative book-seller. Orders
for the approved books will be placed with the representative book-seller and
the bills settled under the University rates.(e)On approval basis: Book-
sellers who have been selected as agents, on the basis of their acceptance to
adopt the University rates, can be permitted to send the latest books on
approval basis. These books will be examined by the concerned Head of
Departments, in the Library and only after obtaining their specific
recommendation, final orders will be placed by the Librarian. The rejected
books will be returned to the book-seller. The book-sellers will be insisted
to allow a period of 30 days for the books sent on approval basis to the
University for the thorough examination by the University.

### 2\. Indian Books. - In the case of Indian books, the University reserves
the right to purchase them directly from the publishers. This does not prevent
the University in getting their required Indian publications through the
agents. Latest Indian Books will be directly purchased from the concerned
Indian publishers without calling for competitive quotations.

### 3\. Publication of learned bodies and society publications. - The
University can procure the publications of learned bodies and other society
publications which are not easily procurable through its agents, directly from
the publishers and settle their bills by UNESCO book coupons.

### 4\. Standing order for special serial publications. - Standing order shall

Bank Drafts with reference to these invoices. These bank drafts will then be
sent to the concerned foreign publishers towards the advance payment of annual
subscriptions of their journals. The particulars of payment and the receipt of
the issues of the journals should be noted in the "Kardex".

C. Procedure for the binding of books(1)A binding register should be

and Technical Sanction

### 1\. For every work proposed to be carried out except petty works and
repairs, the cost of which does not exceed Rs. 1,000/- a detailed estimate
must be prepared by the Estate Officer for the sanction of competent
authority. This sanction is known as the technical sanction to the estimate.

### 2\. On receipt of administrative approval to works costing below Rs.
50,000/-, the Estate Officer should prepare detailed estimates and plans, the
counter signature of the Dean or Director of Research who applied for the
execution of the work should be obtained to the plans and estimates in token
of approval of suitability. Technical sanction should then be accorded.

### 3\. In the case of work costing Rs. 50,000 and above, the procedure
indicated below should be observed. As soon as possible after administrative
approval is obtained to any such building scheme, detailed plans and estimates
should be prepared with lump-sum provision for electrical and sanitary
fittings. When the detailed plans are ready in a rough shape, the Consulting
Architect to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University should consult the Head of
Institution or Director of Research. The Head of the Institution or Director
of Research should also consider specifically such points as layout and
orientation of the buildings on the site with an eye on sanitation, water and
electric supplies and the suitability and economy of arrangement of the
building. The Consulting Architect to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University
should ascertain the exact requirements from the Head of the Institution or
Director of Research and incorporate them in the building plans which are then
to be countersigned. Such approved plans countersigned should not be altered
subsequently, without sanction of the Vice-Chancellor. As soon as the plans
have been countersigned, the Estate Officers should immediately proceed to
obtain technical sanction.

If in the preparation of detailed estimates it is found that the cost will
exceed the estimate administratively approved by more than 10 per cent,
revised administrative approval must be got before technical sanction can be
accorded.B. Preparation of Estimate

### 3\. The papers to be submitted with the project for work will consist of a
report, a specification and a detailed statement of measurements, quantities
and rates, with an abstract showing the total estimated cost in Rupees only of
each item. The form of the abstract will depend on the method proposed for the
execution of the work. If it is intended to purchase supply materials and to
employ labour for construction separately (whether by contract or University
agency), the abstract of the estimate would be so framed as to show
separately, for each distinct item of artificer's work (1) the cost and
quantity of 'labour' and (2) the cost of materials.

But if this is not the case, e.g. when any item of work is to be executed by
contract and it is proposed to contract for the completed items of work, the
abstract of the estimate may show merely the quantity and cost of each item of
work. In the case of a project consisting of several works, and the report may
be a single document for all the works and likewise the specification, but
details of measurements and abstracts may conveniently be prepared for each
work, supplemented by a general abstract bringing the whole together. In the
case of estimates for 'Repairs' or 'Maintenance', only the specification and
the detailed statement of measurements and quantities with the abstracts will
ordinarily be required. The report should state clearly the purpose of the
work estimated for, and explain any peculiarities which require elucidation
including where necessary, the reasons for the adoption of the estimated
project or design in preference to others.

### 4\. To facilitate the preparation of estimates, a schedule of rates of
each kind of work commonly executed should be prepared annually and the rates
entered in an estimate should generally agree with the schedule of rates, but
due to any cause of these are considered not sufficient, or in excess, a
detailed statement must be given in the data sheet showing the manner in which
the rate used in the estimate is arrived at.

### 5\. In the case of materials supplied departmentally, the rates allowed to
the contractor should not allow any profit on the cost of materials.

### 6\. When an extra percentage is allowed on account of special conditions,
it should be so stated in a note at the end of the data statements
accompanying the schedules of rates, and the extra percentage should not be
described as contractor's profit.

### 7\. The schedule of rates should be prepared on the basis of rates
prevailing in the locality or at the Public Works Department schedule of rates
whichever is less and as it is used for the important purpose of preparing
estimates and is also used as a guide in settling rates in contract
agreements, necessary analysis of the rates for each description of work and
the varying conditions thereof should be given as far as practicable. In
working out the rates,- the tenders accepted for works during the twelve
months preceding the date on which their preparation is due to begin the
tendency of rates and prices to rise or fall should be taken into account.
When rates and prices are changing rapidly, the Estate Officer should issue
orders at any time, that a certain percentage should be added to, or deducted
from, all the rates or from certain specified rates or from rates for certain
specified classes of items, e.g. for materials or for labour. In the data
accompanying the schedule of rates for works, the contractor's profit should
not be added as a separate item.

### 8\. In addition to the usual charge of 5 per cent for petty supervision
and contingencies, all incidental expenditure which can be foreseen, such as
compensation for or cost of land, sheds for workmen and stores, should be
separately provided for in the estimate. The provision for contingencies may
not be diverted to any new work or repair which is not provided for in the
estimate and of which the cost exceeds Rs. 2,500/- without the sanction of the
Estate Officer.

### 9\. Important structural designs should, as far as possible, be prepared
by the Estate Officer together with the schedule of quantities, and the
remaining designing work of importance should be concentrated by the Assistant
Engineer or Construction Engineer, the executive officers being left to deal
only with designs for the alterations of existing building and less important
new works. The responsibility for the technical features of a design lies with
the office for origin. Local officers will be responsible, however, for
settling locally, question connected with foundations and other similar
matters. Subordinate Officers should always bring to the notice of their
higher authorities any unsuitability or technical defect in a design.

### 10\. All Tamil Nadu Agricultural University employees should treat the
rate and the amount of cost entered against each item in an estimate and the
abstract showing the total estimated cost or a part of a work as strictly
confidential. No information concerning them may be communicated any account
to any contractor, piece-worker or prospective tenderer.

### 11\. 'Repairs' may be divided into two classes: 'Ordinary' and 'Special'
Ordinary repairs include-

(i)those which, as a matter of regulation, are carried out periodically and
which are usually of the same quantity, from time to time, such as the
painting or whitewashing of a building, or a new costing of metal on a
road;(ii)other occasional petty repairs which may become necessary, from time
to time, and which may have to be carried out between the time of periodical
repairs.

### 12\. (i) Special repairs are other than ordinary repairs, i.e., they are
repairs which are not periodical or frequent, etc, re-roofing a building,
replacing of beams, renewal of flooring, etc.

(ii)In respect of irrigation works, special repairs include all operations
required to maintain the works in a better condition i.e., to an improved
standard by using materials of a more permanent or lasting nature without
increasing the efficiency or scope of the system, e.g., cement plastering or
pointing in place of ordinary plastering or pointing, plastering in place of
pointing, rough stone masonry in place of dry stone packing, revetment to tank
bunds at sites of breaches and to margins of rivers at places where they are
eroded, grouting the surface of the aprons and revetments, lengthening of
aprons and revetments to protect erosions noticed in beds and margins of
rivers, canals and channels.

### 12\.

A. Ordinary repairs: A separate estimate should be prepared annually for all
the anticipated ordinary repairs of each building or work, group of works
during the working years, as detailed in the budget.

### 13\. Estimates for special repairs remain current till the completion of
the repairs in the same manner as estimates for original works.

### 14\. In the cases of urgency, the Estate Officer may authorize the
commencement of periodical repairs in anticipation of the formal sanction of
the estimate; but in such cases, an approximate sum must be fixed, to the
expenditure of which sanction is provisionally given and the Estate Officer
will be responsible that sanction of the competent authority is accorded to
the regular estimate at the earliest possible date.

### 15\. In the case of all descriptions of work, for the renewal of which any
specific period of time has been fixed, the estimate for its repair should
show the date when such item of work was last executed.

### 16\. To facilitate the preparation of estimates of periodical repairs, a
standard measurement book may be kept in the office of the Estate Officer,
showing the detailed measurements of each kind of work, which is usually
subject to renewal in each work under his charge. Standard measurement books
should, however, be maintained properly in the case of repairs to floating
plant which require periodical repairs such as painting and tarring.

### 17\. Except in the case of lump-sum estimates, for ordinary repairs, the
annual expenditure on ordinary repairs to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University
buildings (both residential and non-residential) exclusive of municipal taxes
should be limited to a maximum of 1 = per cent of the capital cost. If, in any
year the expenditure on ordinary repairs to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural
University-buildings, exceeds the limit of 1- per cent, the sanction of the
Estate Officer should be obtained for incurring the excess expenditure.

### 17\.

-A. The Estate Officer may incur expenditure on the maintenance of electrical installations in Tamil Nadu Agricultural University buildings up to a limit of 5 per cent of the capital cost of the installations without reference to higher authorities. In special cases, in which expenditure in excess of the above limit has to be incurred, the sanction of the higher authority viz. the Vice-Chancellor, should be obtained to the excess expenditure. In the case of residential buildings, the provision for repairs to the electrical installations maybe included in the lump-sum provision to be fixed, this particular item of expenditure being exhibited in the expenditure schedules separately as in the case of 'Rates and Taxes' for purposes of accounts.In the case of the installations in non-residential buildings, a consolidated estimate for all the electric installations, should be prepared and sanctioned. A separate working estimate should be sanctioned to cover the expenditure incurred on account of the cost of the establishment employed to look after the installations in both residential and non-residential buildings including special plant and machinery therein and the expenditure may be distributed annually to the estimates of the several buildings concerned for purposes of capital and revenue accounts.

### 18\. Provision for the payment of municipal or other taxes on University
buildings should be made in the annual repair estimates.

### 19\. If the cost of ordinary annual repairs, excluding municipal taxes, to
a building (Residential or Non-residential) is less than Rs. 1,000, the Estate
Officer may prescribe, subject to revision, from time to time, a lump-sum
limited to Rs. 1,000 (plus the amount of municipal taxes, if any, payable by
the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University) to cover the cost of ordinary annual
repairs and within this amount, expenditure will be permissible year after
year without any detailed estimate being prepared. Such lump-sum estimates
should be framed after a consideration of the cost of maintenance in the past
and is not subject to the 2 per cent limit except in the case of residential
buildings. If, in a working year, the estimated cost of ordinary repairs is
more than the permissible limit given above, or if the lump-sum sanctioned by
the Estate Officer is exceeded, a detailed estimate should be prepared in
accordance with the ordinary rules and sanctioned by the competent authority.
On sanction being accorded to such an estimate, the sanctioned lumpsum
estimate would automatically be superseded for the working year in question.

Electrical works: Similar lump-sum estimates may also be prepared and
sanctioned for ordinary repairs to electrical installations in civil
buildings. Where the cost of such annual ordinary repairs is less than Rs.
2,000, the Vice-Chancellor may prescribe subject to revision, from time to
time, a lump-sum limited to Rs. 2,000 to cover the cost of annual maintenance
of electric installations in civil buildings. The Estate Officer may similarly
prescribe lumpsum up to a limit of Rs. 1,000. Within this amount the
expenditure will be permissible year after year without any detailed estimates
being prepared and when the above limits are exceeded in any working year,
detailed estimates will have to be prepared in accordance with the ordinary
rules and got sanctioned by the competent authority.

### 20\. It is irregular to classify under 'Special Repairs' an estimate which
provides for items of ordinary repairs for the reason that the repairs cannot
be completed before the date fixed for the closure of annual maintenance
estimates.

Contracts

### 21\. The works executed by the University are carried out by one of the
under mentioned three methods.

(i)departmentally by the employment of daily labour,(ii)by piece work
agreement in Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Form-II,(iii)by an agreement
in Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Form-Ill based on a lumpsum tender
system, as defined in the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard Specifications.Method:
(i) above is adopted in cases where no contractors are available or where, for
other reasons, it is found more economical. Under this method, the University
manufactures or purchases its own materials. The purchase of materials or
tools and plant and machinery is governed by the stores rules.Under Method:
(ii) the pieceworker is merely to execute a specified work at specified rates
without reference to quantity or time. The conditions of the contract and the
security to be taken from the piece worker for the due fulfillment of the
contract are set forth in form P.W.D. V. 51. The piece-worker usually
possesses little professional knowledge or capital and employs no supervising
staff. The University arranges for supervision, the setting out and the
measuring of all work. The piece-work system shall ordinarily be confined to
works (including improvements and repairs) costing not more than 1,00,000. If
in any case of improvements and repairs costing about Rs. 1,00,000 is
considered preferable to adopt the piece work system instead of method (iii),
the reasons therefor should be recorded in the relevant file. In special
tracts, where good contractors may not be available, the piecework system may
be adopted even for original works costing above Rs. 1,00,000. The schedule of
rates in the piece work agreements should show rates either for finished work
or for labour and materials, as the case maybe, even for items for which
lumsumps have been provided in the sanctioned estimates.In regard to method
(iii), the details are set forth clearly in-(1)The Preliminary Specification
of the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard Specifications.(2)The standardized forms
of articles of agreement, tender notice and tender mentioned in the Tamil Nadu
Detailed Standard Specifications and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University work
Forms Nos. I, II, III.(3)The intermediate and the final bill forms connected
therewith. University Bill Form No. IV and V.In the case of each work executed
under Method (ii) or Method (iii), the authority accepting the contract will
decide whether it is desirable to retain, in the hands of the University the
surplus of imported stores or other materials.In case where it is decided that
the University should supply certain materials to the contractor for use on
the work, a description of every such material and the rate and place at which
it will be supplied should be specified in the notice called for tenders and
also in the schedule forming part of the agreement. In cases where the
contractors are allowed to supply the required imported articles themselves,
the description of such articles must be clearly defined by governing
specifications. For cases where the 'British Standard Specifications'
standards are not applicable other suitable methods should be adopted, such
as, specifying the catalogue number product of a reputable firm. When test
certificates are demanded, full particulars shall be given in the tender
notice and the agreements and it shall also be stated therein that the cost of
furnishing such certificates shall be borne by the contractors.

### 22\. Before a work is given out on contract, the authority competent to
accept the contract must prepare 'contract documents' to include:

(i)a complete set of drawing showing the general dimensions of the proposed
work and so far as necessary details of the various parts works to be done
under lumpsum items in the schedule to the agreement should be clearly defined
by specifications or drawings, as necessary;(ii)complete specifications of the
work to be done and of the materials to be used, unless reference can be made
to specifications contained in the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard specifications
and into Addenda volume - (in the case of the items of work for which there
are already standard specifications the numbers of the relevant specifications
of the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard Specifications should be referred to in
the schedule attached to the agreement.)(iii)a schedule of the quantities of
the various descriptions of work. (This is necessary only in the case of
contracts based on the lump-sum tender system as defined in the Tamil Nadu
Detailed Standard Specifications.) In such a case, the total under the
schedule of the agreement must be equal to the lump-sum entered in the
agreement, and,(iv)a set of 'conditions of contract' to amplify as necessary
the preliminary and other specifications of the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard
Specifications forming part of contracts based on the lump-sum tender system
(in the case of piecework contracts, the conditions considered necessary for
any particular case in addition to those printed in Form TNAU - Work Form No.
1 should be attached to the agreement).

### 23\. The terms of a contract must be precise and definite and there must
be no room for ambiguity of mis-construction therein. No contract involving an
uncertain or indefinite liability or any condition of an unusual character
should be entered into without the previous consent of the competent
authority. If the contract, even when it is within the powers of acceptance of
the constructions or Maintenance Engineer or Assistant Engineer is to be of a
very special nature, he should, before inviting tenders publicly, submit the
contract documents to the Estate Officer for his approval or remarks together
with a copy of the proposed advertisement for tenders and the form in which
the tenders are to be submitted. The Estate Officer should, similarly when the
amount of the contract is likely to exceed his powers of acceptance or when it
is to be a very special nature, submit the contract documents to the Vice-
Chancellor for approval.

### 24\. Contracts should where possible, be executed on one or other of the
standard forms, but they may be modified to suit the requirements of any
particular case, or for works of great magnitude, after consultation with the
legal advisors of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. In cases where it is
considered that none of the standard forms can be used even with suitable
modifications, the contracts should be got prepared specially by the Tamil
Nadu Agricultural University Law Officers. Estate Officer and other employees
under him are responsible that the terms of contract arc strictly enforced and
that no act is done tending to nullify or vitiate a contract.

All agreements entered into with the University by contractors for the
execution of works are exempt from stamp duty.

### 25\. Tenders which should always be sealed, should invariably be invited
in the most open and public manner possible, whether by advertisement in the
local newspapers, or by notice in English and the Vernacular pasted in public
places, and tenderers should have free access to the contract documents. The
notice should in all cases state. - (i) when and where the contract documents
can be seen and the blank forms of tender can be obtained and also the amount
to be paid for sets of plans or other tender documents, (ii) when and where
tenders are to be submitted and are to be opened (in the case of large
contracts, the date of receipt of tenders should be at least one month after
the date of first advertisement or notice); (iii) the amount of earnest money
to accompany the tender, and the amount and nature of the security deposit
required in the case of the accepted tender; in the case of lump-sum
contracts, the amount of earnest money and that of the additional security,
and in the case of piece-work contracts the amount of earnest money, should
each be 2'/2 per cent of the estimated amount of the contract when the
contract is only for part of the work included in the estimate; and (iv) with
whom or what authority the acceptance of the contract will rest. Authority
should always be reserved to reject any, or all, of the tenders so received
without the assignment of a reason, and this should be expressly stated in the
advertisement.

In the case of works to be given on contract based on lump-sum tender, as
defined in the Tamil Nadu Standard Specifications, the forms of tender notice
and tender (standardized as Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Form No. I and
II) should be used with such modifications as any particular work may
require.No tender should be accepted from any person directly or indirectly
connected with the University service.The Estate Officer or an authorised
employee should open the tenders in the presence of the tenderers or their
authorised agents who may choose to be present at the time. The Officer
opening the tenders should also initial all corrections in each tender, which
have been initialled by the tenderer. If there are corrections in the tender
unattested by the tenderer, a note of such corrections should be made on the
tender itself, when it is opened. The Officer opening the tender should keep a
personal note of the total number of tenders opened by him and verify
therewith the number in the comparative statement of tenders.After the receipt
of the comparative statement and before the selection of a tenderer, the
officer concerned should examine all the tenders and satisfy himself that no
corrections which were not in the tenders at the time he received them had
been made in any of them.

### 26\. As a rule, no tender for the execution of works of any description
should be received unless accompanied by a bank draft endorsed to the
Comptroller, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University for earnest money to the
extent which has been notified as necessary in the tender notice. The earnest
money is the guarantee of the tenderer to deposit the requisite security and
to enter into the required agreement on intimation of the acceptance of his
tender. It is forfeited in case of default.

### 27\. In selecting the lender to be accepted, the financial status of the
tenderers, their capability, the security offered by them or the record of
their execution of any works previously should be taken into consideration.
Other conditions being equal, the lowest tender should be accepted. In cases
where a tender other than the lowest is accepted, a confidential record should
be kept of the reasons for doing so. This confidential record should be shown
to the audit if required.

The acceptance or rejection of tenders is, however, left entirely to the
discretion of the officer to whom the duty is entrusted and no tenderer can
demand the cause of rejection of his offer. Such an explanation may, however,
be called for by a superior authority, if considered necessary.

### 28\. The forms of security to be taken in the case of piece work contracts
is laid down in the conditions printed in Tamil Nadu Agricultural University
Work Form No. I.

The forms of security to be taken in the case of contracts based on the lump-
sum tender system, as defined in the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard
Specifications, are given in the forms of tender notice and articles of
agreement connected therewith.

### 29\. Originals of tenders and agreement for execution of work approved by
the Estate Officer or by higher authorities should be kept in the personal
custody of the Estate Officer or by an employee authorised by him. Fib should
maintain a careful check of all original tenders and agreements that are put
up for reference in connection with audit of bills, etc., or sent to Assistant
Agricultural Engineers or Construction Engineers. When copies of such tenders
and agreements are issued to other officers or contractors, the Estate Officer
should see that the copies are correctly transcribed from the original and
should sign them himself. Similarly, originals of the tenders and the
agreements approved by Assistant Engineers/Construction Engineers should be
kept in their personal custody and they are responsible for their safe
preservation. Copies made for submission to the Estate Officer or for issue to
contractors should be signed by the Assistant Engineers.

At the time of transfer of charge, a written statement of original tenders and
agreements handed over and taken over should be made out and signed by the
relieved and the relieving employees.

### 30\. No authority lower than Assistant Engineer can accept any tender or
make a contract for Civil Works. The Officers legally empowered to execute on
behalf of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, the different classes of
deeds, contracts and other instruments are detailed in the Statutes. This
power is, however in each case, subject to the University rules laying down
the powers of officers to enter into contracts.

### 31\. An officer empowered to enter into contracts may, after the estimate
has been duly sanctioned, give out to different contractors a number of
contracts relating to one work, even though the estimated cost of work may
exceed the amount up to which he is empowered to accept tenders, provided
there are special orders to the contrary, and the amount of each contract is
within the limit of the officer's power to accept tenders. But, no contract
may be entered into with any individual contractor in excess of this limit nor
may a second contract be entered in connection with the same work which is
still in force, if the sum of the contracts exceeds the power of acceptance of
tenders of the authority concerned.

### 32\. The following rules must be carefully noted:-

(1)No officer may enter into a contract into which he is not empowered to call
for tender.(2)No authority may accept any contract for a work until an
assurance has been received from the authority competent to provide funds for
the same, that such funds will be allotted before the liability matures.(3)On
no account should rates in excess of those provided in the agreement he paid,
as the payment of such rates which are not due would nullify the
contract.(4)Duplication of agreements should, in no case, be required, that is
to say, an authority who has concluded an agreement should not be required to
draw up and sign again an agreement already executed.Starting workIt is
fundamental rule that no work shall be begun unless a properly detailed design
and estimate have been sanctioned, allotment of funds made, and order to begin
issued by competent authority. Provision in the budget conveys no authority
for outlay. The exceptions are petty works, repairs in cases of real emergency
which must be reported immediately to the authorities competent to accord
administrative approval and technical sanction. Similarly, the sanction of a
design and estimate by an authority, whatever, conveys no permission to start
expenditure unless funds have been provided for the expenditure by competent
authority.Further, no liability may be incurred, and no officer may accept a
contract for any work, until an assurance has been received from the authority
competent to provide funds that such funds will be allotted before the
liability matures.

### 33\. Ordinarily no work executed by method (ii) or method (iii) described
in paragraph 21 should be started without a formal agreement or contract
sanctioned by a competent authority. The procedure to be followed in emergent
works is described in paragraph 37.

### 34\. No formal agreement is necessary in regard to petty works and
repairs, the estimated cost of which is Rs. 1,000 or less, but even in these
cases, there should be some written understanding though not in any prescribed
form specifying prices and rates.

### 35\. (a) When a contractor refuses to execute work at the rates provided
in his piece work agreement, then, the agreement should be terminated and the
work measured up and paid for at the rates in the sanctioned agreement
enforcing or not, as the case may be, the forfeiture of the security deposit.
The work should not then be given out at higher rates, unless open tenders
have been called for and the most favourable rates obtained.

(b)Revision of rates in accepted agreements of any kind, during the currency
of such agreements are normally prohibited. In cases, however, where the
Estate Officer considers there are sufficient reasons to revise rates in
current agreements then the sanction of the authority above that which
accepted the agreement should be obtained, placing on record with the amount
of work to be done under the concerned items and on the total amount of the
work to be done under the agreement. Whenever revised rates in an agreement
are sanctioned, the increased rates will have effect only from the date of
sanction of Such revised rates, unless it is specially stated by the
sanctioning authority that they should have retrospective effect.(c)In all
cases, as in (a) and (b), it must be observed, that the rules governing such
estimate revision as may be involved are complied with.(d)The corrections in
agreements should be attested under dated initials by the accepting authority
also not only to indicate his acceptance of the altered rates, but also to
prevent any tampering with agreements after approval.(e)In all cases in which
work not covered by the original agreement is ordered the rate for such items
of work should be settled as laid down in clause 7 of the conditions printed
in the form of piece work agreement or clause 63 of the Preliminary
Specification of the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard Specifications. Such extra
items of work should not be ordered by the Estate Officer on his own
responsibility, if the revised estimate or deviation statement provided for
them requires the sanction of a higher authority.(f)In respect of fines or
forfeiture of deposit ordered by an authority with reference to the relevant
conditions in the forms of agreement or relevant clauses of the preliminary
specifications to the Tamil Nadu Detailed Standard Specifications in an
agreement in use in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University the authority
higher than the one who has accepted the agreement may in his absolute
discretion alive or modify the fine or forfeiture imposed by a lower
authority.

### 36\. If in any case, whether on grounds of urgency or otherwise an
executive officer is required to carry out a work for which no estimates have
been sanctioned or for which no financial provision exists (whether estimates
have been sanctioned or not), the orders of the officer authorising the work
should be conveyed in writing. On receipt of such written orders, the officer
who is directed to carry out the work should immediately intimate to the
Comptroller that he is incurring a liability for which there is no provision
or inadequate provision of funds and should, at the same time, state
approximately the amount of the liability which, it is likely, he will incur
by compliance with the written orders, which he has received. The Comptroller
will then be responsible for bringing the facts instantly to the notice of the
Vice-Chancellor.

### 37\. If, in the case of a work executed on the contract or piece-work
system, the circumstances are so emergent that it is impossible to enter into
a formal contract or agreement, the officer on the spot who starts the work
should enter into a piece-work agreement at least in the first instance. This
form of agreement is particularly suitable as it is terminable in case the
higher authorities, who are competent to sanction the proper agreement in the
standard form, disapprove when the circumstances are so emergent that even a
piece-work agreement cannot be signed, it will be sufficient to have a written
order for the work signed both by the piece-workers or the contractor and the
officer on the spot. There should, however, be no avoidable delay in preparing
a proper estimate and an agreement in the standard form and in obtaining the
sanction of the competent authority.

### 38\. The sanction to an estimate must on all occasions be looked upon as
strictly limited to the precise objects for which the estimate was intended to
provide. Accordingly, any anticipated or actual savings on a sanctioned
estimate for a definite work should not without special authority, be applied
to carry out additional work not contemplated in the original project on
fairly contingent on its actual execution.

Savings due to the abandonment of a substantial section of any project
sanctioned by any authority are not to be considered as available for work on
other sections without the further sanction of that authority.

### 39\. In exceptional cases where it is desirable to begin work on a project
which has been administratively approved, before the detailed estimate for the
whole project has been prepared, it is permissible for the authority competent
to sanction the final technical estimate as a whole, to accord sanction to
detailed estimates for component parts of the project, subject to the
following conditions.

(1)For each such work or component part, there must be a fully prepared
detailed estimate and, in the administrative approval as a whole, there must
be a clear and specific amount corresponding to the work or component part in
question.(2)The amount of the detailed estimate must not exceed the amount
included in the administrative approval by more than 10 per cent.(3)The
sanctioning authority must be satisfied, before according sanction, that the
amount of the technical sanction for the whole project is not likely to exceed
the amount of the administrative approval and that the work or component part
in question can be appropriately commenced without affecting, or being
affected by, any other part of the project financially or otherwise.

### 40\. To obviate delay in commencing work on a detailed estimate, for a
complete project which has been prepared and submitted for technical sanction,
but which requires minor amendments in the design or estimate, the sanctioning
authority should adopt one or other of the following courses.

(1)Amend the design or estimate in his own office and sanction it or (2)
sanction the parts of the estimate which are approved subject to conditions
(2) and (3) specified in paragraph 39 and call for amended detailed estimates
for the other portions of the project.

### 41\. The approval or sanction to an estimate for any work other than
annual repairs will, unless such work has been commenced, cease to operate
after a period of five years from the date upon which it was accorded.

### 42\. Where important structural alterations are contemplated though not
necessarily involving an increased outlay, orders of the original sanctioning
authority should be obtained. A revised estimate should be submitted for
technical sanction, should the alterations involve any substantial change in
the cost of the work.

Supplementary Estimates

### 43\. Any development of a project though necessary while a work is in the
progress, which is not fairly contingent on the proper execution of the work
as first sanctioned, must be covered by a supplementary estimate, accompanied
by a full report of the circumstances which render it necessary.

The following particulars should, invariably, be furnished when submitting
supplementary estimates for sanction.(1)Every supplementary estimate should be
numbered consecutively as first supplementary estimate, second supplementary
estimate, third supplementary estimate and so on; and(2)The application for
sanction to supplementary estimates should show the amount of the original
estimate and the total amount including the supplementary estimate for which
sanction is sought and also of the supplementary estimates sanctioned
previously.Revised Estimates

### 44\. A revised estimate must be submitted when the sanctioned estimate is
likely to be exceeded by more than 5 per cent for any cause whatever, or when
material developments or deviations have necessitated revised administrative
approval, it must be accompanied by a report showing the progress made to date
and explaining fully the cause of the revision. The revised estimate need not
contain details of items which are not altered, but merely a note to this
effect, but the altered items should be shown in a comparative statement. The
sanctioned estimate must accompany a revised estimate. It is the duty of the
Estate Officer to see that a revised estimate is prepared and disposed of
direct when necessity arises.

### 45\. When excess occurs at such an advanced period in the construction of
a work as to render the submission of a revised estimate purposeless, the
excesses, if beyond the power of the Estate Officer, to pass must be explained
in a completion report.

Completion Reports

### 46\. A consolidated completion report in Tamil Nadu Agricultural
University Works Form No. VII should be prepared monthly of all completed
works other than those referred to in clause (b), the actual expenditure on
which is in excess of the sanctioned estimate by an amount greater than that
which the Estate Officer is empowered to pass. This report should show for
each work or group of works the estimated cost, the outlay, the excess, when
the completion report is utilised instead of a revised estimate, sufficient
details must be given, if the excess is more than 5 per cent to satisfy the
authority whose sanction is necessary.

(b)A detailed completion report in Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Works
Form No. VI need only be prepared in respect of work on which the outlay has
been recorded by sub-heads.(i)When, if the work was sanctioned by higher
authority, the total estimate has been exceeded by more than 5 per
cent.(ii)When, if the work was sanctioned by the Estate Officer the total
estimate has been exceeded by an amount greater than that which he is
empowered to pass.This report should give a comparison and explanation of
differences between the quantity rate and cost of the work executed and those
entered in the estimate.

### 47\. It is left to the Estate Officer when starling the execution of the
work to decide whether intermediate completion reports may be submitted for
important component works forming part of a large scheme.
