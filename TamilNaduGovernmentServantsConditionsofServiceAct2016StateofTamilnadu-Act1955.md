(See section 27)The method of carrying forward of vacancies reserved for the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes candidates by direct recruitment is
illustrated below:-If five vacancies reserved for the candidates belonging to
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes remain unfilled in earlier years and
they are carried forward as "backlog" vacancies and fifty new vacancies arise
in the year of recruitment of which nine vacancies are to be reserved for the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes fifteen vacancies for the Backward
Classes, ten vacancies for the Most Backward Classes and Denotified
Communities and sixteen vacancies for open competition following the existing
instructions on reservation, the number of vacancies to be announced shall be
as follows:-

Current Vacancies | Backlog vacancies  
---|---  
| Open competition | Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes | Backward Classes |  Most Backward Classes and DenotifiedCommunities | Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes  
Number of posts | 16 | 9 | 15 | 10 | 5  
  
It may be seen from the above that while the vacancies reserved for the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which remain unfilled shall be carried
forward to the next year of recruitment as "backlog" vacancies, the carried
forward reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the 1st
April 1989 as a result of the filling up of the relevant vacancies after
dereservation, shall continue to be operated against "current" vacancies. If
such reserved vacancies are still not filled up, they shall be carried forward
as "back log" vacancies.While the ban on dereservation comes into effect on
the 1st April 1989 in respect of direct recruitment to Group A, B, C & D in
case of vacancies in Groups A and B Services, there may be rare and
exceptional cases where after the non-availability of suitable candidates
belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes posts cannot be allowed
to remain vacant in public interest. In such situations, the Administrative
Department under which the recruitment is being made shall make a proposal for
dereservation giving full justification for such action, and consult the
Director of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare and the Secretary to Government,
Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare and obtain the comments on each proposal.
After obtaining the comments of the Director of Adi Dravidar and Tribal
Welfare and the Secretary, Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, the
administrative department shall then place the proposal for dereservation
along with the comments of the Director of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare
before a committee comprising the Secretary to Government, Adi Dravidar and
Tribal Welfare Department, the Secretary to Government, Personnel and
Administrative Reforms Department and the Secretary to Government in charge of
the Department to which the recruitment is being made for consideration and
recommendation. The recommendation of this committee shall be placed before
the Minister in charge of the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department
and the Minister for Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare, for a final decision.In
case of such vacancies reserved for Most Backward Classes and Denotified
Communities, the administrative department in which the recruitment is being
made shall make a proposal for dereservation giving full justification for
such action, and consult the Director of Most Backward Classes and Denotified
Communities and obtain the comments on each proposal. After obtaining the
comments of the Director of Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities
and the Secretary to Government in charge of the department for the welfare of
the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities, the Administrative
Department shall then place the proposal for dereservation along with the
comments of the Director of Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities
before a committee comprising the Secretary to Government in charge of the
Department for the welfare of the Most Backward Classes and Denotified
Communities, the Secretary to Government, Personnel and Administrative Reforms
Department and the Secretary to Government in charge of the Department in
which the recruitment is being made for consideration and recommendation. The
recommendation of this Committee shall be placed before the Minister in charge
of the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department and the Minister for
Backward Classes, Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities Welfare for
a final decision.
