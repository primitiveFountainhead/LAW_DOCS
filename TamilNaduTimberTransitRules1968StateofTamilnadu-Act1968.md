Appendix IRules Relating to Elephant Catching Operations(G. O. No. 793,
Revenue, dated the 10th November 1894 B.PF. No. 401, dated the 5th July 1895,
recorded in G.O. Ms. No. 2963, Revenue, dated the 25th July 1895.)Rules for
Capturing Elephants by Pitfall System

### 1\. Elephants have a habit of wandering in herds from place to place and
they generally keep to the same runs in moving to and fro. These runs must be
discovered and pits dug on them in groups of three thus @ according to the lie
of the ground.

### 2\. The pits should be 12 feet by 12 feet at top and 9 feet by 9 feet at
bottom and 10 to 12 feet deep. The slopping sides are intended to break the
fall. Brushwood and bundles of grass, if available, should be laid at the
bottom of the pit to a depth of 3 or 4 feet as a further precaution against
injury to an animal falling in and care must be taken to renew the bedding
from time to time, as lis liable to sink and harden after some days. The earth
excavated should be removed to a distance and spread out or covered by dead
leaves or twigs. The mouths of the pits are closed by split bamboos laid
crosswise and covered with A, layer of grass or leaves so-as to conceal their
existence.

### 3\. One or more watchers or forest guards must be appoint to inspect the
pits every day and bring information of any capture, or damage to the pit. A
Forest or Range Officer should inspect all the pits once a fort night to see
that they are properly maintained and the results of his inspection should be
reported to his immediate superior. It frequently happens that sambhur, bison,
deer and other wild animals fall into the pits. They must be immediately
released without injury and the pits closed as before.

If it is not intended to maintain and watch any pit they should be at once
uncovered and any contrivances used to conceal their existence removed. Early
measures should also be taken to fill up all disused pits with brustwood or
billets of wood, or with earth if it is intended to close the pit permanently.

### 4\. In the event of an elephant being entrapped the forest subordinate on
the spot should at once send word for decoy elephants watching and remaining
at the pit with a gang of hillmen so as to prevent other elephants coming to
the rescue. Elephants past the prime of life are not fit to be tamed as they
pine and die. It is advisable to let them go which is done by throwing in
billets of wood or twings into the pit. If a mother and a calf fall in the
same pit, the mother if she is considered undesirable as a captive, should
similarly be liberated and may be driven away by firing a few blank, shots or
otherwise, as soon as she comes out of the pit. Elephants from 4 to 7 feet
height have been found by experience to be Successful captures.

### 5\. As soon as the report of a capture is received, four decoy elephants
should be marched off to the pit with the least possible delay. The animal
should not be allowed to remain more than 48 hours in the pit. If the capture
is small, three or even two decoy animals will suffice. The captive is noosed
in the neck and one hind leg below the knee and above the ankle by soft cords
(2 inches or more in diameter and 30 yards long) previously made of fibrous
barks or manilla hemp. The necessary ropes must always be kept ready prepared.
The size of the neck is generally one-eighth less than the height of the
animal. The noose is made to that size and a-peg-driven across the rope so as
to prevent its slipping, lower by tension. This precaution is not necessary
for the leg noose. On the noose round the neck, two pieces of cords about two
yards long are attached one on either side for the decoy elephants to hold.
Billets of wood and twigs are thrown into the pit to lesson the depth and
enable the captive to ascend, and as soon as he is, out, a ring of the decoy
animals is formed the cords on either side of the neck noose are seized by two
elephants and the end of the noose cord itself by another in front, and one
remains in the rear. The leg cord is held by a number of collies and the
captive is thus marched to the kraal.

### 6\. The kraal is a building 12 feet by 12 feet constructed of eight wooden
posts 15 inches square and 12 feet height and cross bars 6 inches by 4 inches
driven across 14 inches apart, with a thatched roof on top, the floor to be
planked with a gentle slope and necessary drain all round outside, the lower
bars on one side are drawn out sufficiently to admit the captive, who is
showed in by the rear decoy, the front decoy turning aside and the two side
ones keeping position. The bars are closed immediately the animal enters and
the neck noose and leg noose cut as under by a broad chisel. Water is then
copiously poured on the animal and sufficient fodder provided. A wooden trough
full of drinking water is also placed by the side of the kraal outside.

### 7\. A mahout is appointed to train the animal, and an assistant to help in
removing dung, etc. The pouring of water frequently should be continued for
some days. In about a month the mahout will be able to enter the kraal without
danger, and in three months the animal gets tamed and fit to be let out of the
kraal, having by that time learnt to obey orders, to turn right and left, to
kneel, to lie down on either side to move backward and forward, and to pick up
a stick. The administration of jaggery and plantains occasionally and kind
treatment will tame an animal very quickly.

### 8\. The kraal must be inspected daily by the superior officer, or an upper
subordinate whose constant personal attention is necessary to see that the
kraal is kept clean and the animal washed twice a day, and proper fodder
provided. It is a common habit on the part of mahout to beat the animal
mercilessly which must never be allowed.

### 9\. Carbolic acid in eight parts of coconut oil should be applied to
bruises and wounds. Care should be taken that maggots are not allowed to
generate. The wounds may be washed by a garden syringe until the animal is
accessible.
