The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972(57 of 1972)Last
Updated 20th January, 2020 [11/596]Statement of Objects and Reasons. - By the
General Insurance (Emergency Provisions) Ordinance, 1971, which was later
replaced by an Act of Parliament the management of the undertakings of all
insurers carrying on general insurance business was vested in the Central
Government, pending nationalisation.The object of the present Bill is to
complete the process of nationalisation which is sought to be effected in the
following manner. On a day, to be appointed by the Central Government, the
shares in insurance companies carrying on general insurance business, which
are incorporated in India and having a share capital, would automatically
stand transferred to, and vested in, the Central Government. A few shares,
however, would thereafter be formally transferred to, the nominees of the
Central Government in order to enable each of the Indian insurance companies
to function as a Government company. On the appointed day, the undertakings of
all other insurers, including foreign insurers, and the L.I.C. insofar as it
relates to the general insurance business carried on by it, would also stand
transferred to, and vested in, such one or other of the Indian insurance
companies as the Central Government may specify.It is also proposed to form
under the Companies Act, 1956, a Government Company, to be called General
Insurance Corporation of India, which will be entrusted with the task of
supervising, controlling and carrying on the business of general insurance. On
the formation of the Corporation, the shares of the Indian Insurance
Companies, vested in the Central Government would stand automatically
transferred to the Corporation and all the Indian Insurance Companies would
become the subsidiaries of the Corporation.The Bill further provides for the
framing of one or more schemes whereby the Indian Insurance Companies would so
get merged in one another that ultimately there will be only four Indian
Companies, so situated as to promote competition between them so that
effective services in the field of general insurance may be rendered by them
in all part of India.Amendment Act 3 of 1985-Statement of Objects and Reasons.
- In Ajay Kumar Banerjee v. Union of India (A.I.R.1984 S.C. 1130) the Supreme
Court held that section 16 of the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation)
Act, 1972 does not permit the framing of any scheme which is unconnected with,
or unrelated to, the merger of one insurance company with another insurance
company or the formation of a new company by the amalgamation of two or more
insurance companies. In order to control the cost of administration in the
interests of the General Insurance Corporation of India and the acquiring
companies and their policy holders, Government considered it necessary to vest
itself with powers to frame further schemes of nationalisation or revision of
pay scales and other conditions of service applicable to officers and other
employees and also to confer on the Central Government other necessary power
and to revalidate the existing scheme and other actions taken in the past.
Hence, the President promulgated on the 17th September, 1984, the General
Insurance Business (Nationalisation), Amendment Ordinance, 1984 to amend the
General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 to empower the Central
Government to frame further schemes of nationalisation or revision of pay
scales and other terms and conditions of service of all officers and other
employees of the Corporation and of the acquiring companies and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto.Amendment Act 38 of 1989-Statement
of Objects and Reasons. - The authorised capital of the General Insurance
Corporation of India is at present rupees seventy-five crores as provided in
sub-section (2) of section 9 of the General Insurance Business
(Nationalisation) Act, 1972.There has been a substantial accretion to the free
reserves of the General Insurance Corporation of India on account of its
continued good performance. As a result of the said accretion, the General
Insurance Corporation of India has made two bonus issues and at present the
paid-up capital of the said Corporation stands at rupees sixty-four crores and
fifty lakhs. The said Corporation is also expected to make further bonus
issues in the near future and as a result of such issues, the paid-up capital
of the Corporation would go up beyond the existing authorised capital of
rupees seventy-five crores. It is, therefore, necessary that the present
authorised capital of rupees seventy-five crores is increased to rupees two
hundred and fifty crores to enable the said Corporation to make further bonus
issues over a period of next ten years.Amendment Act 40 of 2002-Statement of
Objects and Reasons. - The General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) was
formed as a Government company under sub-section (1) of section 9 of the
General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 (GIBNA, 1972). It was
entrusted with the task of superintending, controlling and carrying on the
business of general insurance. On the formation of the GIC, the shares of the
Indian insurance companies, which vested in the Central Government, were
transferred to the GIC and all the Indian insurance companies became the
subsidiaries of the Corporation. Under the schemes framed under GIBNA,1972,
the Indian insurance companies got merged in one another and ultimately four
Indian companies, namely, the National Insurance Company Limited, the New
India Assurance Company Limited, the Oriental Insurance Company Limited and
the United India Insurance Company Limited are left which are so situated as
to promote competition between them so that effective services in the field of
general insurance be rendered by them in all parts of India.2\. The Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999 (IRDA) Act, 1999 incorporated a
new sub-clause (c) in clause (7-A) of section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1938
under which an Indian insurance company can carry on life insurance business
or general insurance business or re-insurance business. Clause (ii) of sub-
section (8) of section 101-A of the Insurance Act, 1938 also defines the
expression "Indian re-insurer" to mean an insurer, specified in sub-clause (b)
of clause (9) of section 2 of the said Act, who carries on exclusively re-
insurance business and is approved in this behalf by the Central
Government.3\. At present, the General Insurance Corporation of India is
undertaking re-insurance business in India and also underwriting direct
general insurance business in civil aviation and crop insurance. GIC is also
the holding company of four subsidiary insurance companies mentioned in the
first paragraph which are carrying on general insurance business. In view of
the aforesaid provisions in the Insurance Act, 1938 and the IRDA Act, 1999,
GIC can carry on exclusively re-insurance business or general insurance
business. The Central Government has decided to entrust re-insurance business
to GIC and delink the said four subsidiary companies carrying on general
insurance business from GIC. While the ceasing of underwriting of civil
aviation and crop insurance business by GIC is being dealt with
administratively, it is proposed to delink GIC from its subsidiaries by making
necessary amendments in GIBNA, 1972.4\. With the enactment of GIBNA in the
year 1972, the share capital of insurance companies which stood transferred to
and vested in the Central Government was immediately transferred to and vested
in GIC. It is now proposed to transfer back to the Central Government, the
share capital of the subsidiary companies [vested in GICI by making necessary
amendment in GIBNA, 1972.[20th September, 1972]An Act to provide for the
acquisition and transfer of shares of Indian insurance companies and
undertakings of other existing insurers in order to serve better the need of
the economy by securing the development of general insurance business in the
best interests of the community and to ensure that the operation of the
economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth to the common
detriment, for the regulation and control of such business and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto.[The Economic Times analysed THE
