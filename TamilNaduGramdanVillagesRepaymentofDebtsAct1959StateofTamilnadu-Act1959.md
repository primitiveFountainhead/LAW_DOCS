Tamil Nadu Gramdan Villages (Repayment of Debts) Act, 1959(Tamil Nadu Act 6 of
1959)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Gramdan Villages (Repayment
of Debts) Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 6 of 1959). - The landholders in Gramdan
villages, who have surrendered their rights over their lands in favour of the
village community, are subjected to more than the usual pressure for the
repayment of debts as their creditors are afraid that their loans will become
insecure and prove irrecoverable. The question was, therefore, considered
whether any special legislation should be undertaken for imposing a moratorium
for a specified period on repayment of loans outstanding from persons residing
in those villages where Gramdan has made considerable progress. The Government
have decided that the moratorium should be in the form of staying execution of
a decree in respect of debts due from persons residing in any of the villages
specified in the Schedule to the Bill for a period of one year against their
persons and property-movable or immovable. The debtors in the scheduled
villages are permitted to pay the debts in three equal annual instalments
after the expiry of the period of one year. The Bill when enacted will be
applicable to the villages specified in the Schedule to the Bill, but the
State Government may include any other village in the Schedule. Debts due to
the Central Government and the State Government or co-operative societies
will, however, be exempted from the proposed moratorium.2\. The Bill seeks to
give effect to the above objects.Published in Part IV-A of the Fort St. George
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 9th March 1959.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Gramdan Villages (Repayment of Debts) Act, 1960 (Tamil
Nadu Act 5 of 1960). - The landholders in Gramdan Villages, who have
surrendered their rights over their lands in favour of the Village community,
are subject to more than the usual pressure for the repayment of debts as
their creditors, are afraid that their loans will become insecure and prove
irrecoverable. The question was, therefore, considered whether any special
legislation should be undertaken for imposing a moratorium for a specified
period on repayment of loans outstanding from persons residing in those
villages where Gramdan has made considerable progress and accordingly the
Madras Gramdan Villages (Repayment of Debts) Act, 1959 (Madras Act 6 of 1959),
was enacted. The moratorium under that Act was in the form of staying
execution of decrees in respect of debts due from persons residing in any of
the villages specified in the Schedule to the Act for a period of one year
against their persons and property-movable or immovable, and the debtors in
the Scheduled villages permitted to pay the debts in three equal annual
instalments after the expiry of the period of one year. The Act is applicable
to the villages specified in the Schedule to the Act, but the State Government
may include any other village in the Schedule. Debts due to the Central
Government and the State Government or cooperative societies are, however,
exempted from the moratorium. The period of moratorium is due to expire by 6th
May 1960.It has been represented that the seasonal conditions in Gramdan
villages during 1959-60 were not favourable to the Gramdanis due to want of
timely rains for dry crops, that the agricultural produce were hardly
sufficient to' meet their domestic needs after repayment of the instalments
due to Government loans and that in some places the Gramdanis were not able
even to repay the Government loans. It has also been represented that the
Gramdanis have not enjoyed the fruit of the Gramdan movement fully. Hence, it
is proposed to extend the period of moratorium for a further period of one
year by suitably amending the Act for the purpose.The Bill seeks to give
effect to the above object.Published in Part IV-Section 3 of the Fort St.
George Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 27th April 1960.Received the assent of
the Governor on the 7th May 1959 and first published in the Fort St. George
Gazette Extraordinary, dated 7th May 1959.An Act to provide for temporary

[Substituted for the expression 'State of Madras' by the Tamil Nadu Adaptation
of Laws Order, 1969, as amended by the Tamil Nadu Adaptation of Laws (Second
Amendment) Order, 1969.];And Whereas the steps necessary to provide
agricultural credit in those villages and hamlets and for discharging already
existing debts of persons residing in those villages and hamlets are not yet
complete;And Whereas if creditors' are allowed to resort to Court for
