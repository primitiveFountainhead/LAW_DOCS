### 1119.

Act No. 6 of 1986.- Additional duty at the rate of 15 per cent of the basic
excise duty (Leviable under the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944) is leviable
on textiles and textiles articles specified in the Schedule to the Additional
Duties of Excise (Textile and Textile Articles) Act, 1978. The tariff entries
in the Schedule to the Act are adopted from the First Schedule to the Central
Excise and Salt Act, 1944.2\. It is proposed to specify the central excise
tariff by a separate Central Excise Tariff Act which will replace the existing
tariff as contained in the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act
which will replace the existing tariff as contained in the First Schedule to
the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944. The new tariff proposed will be more
detailed and comprehensive. It is, therefore, necessary to make the requisite
consequential changes in the Additional Duties of Excise (Textile and Textile
Articles) Act, 1978, so as to conform to the entries in the new central excise
tariff.[6th December, 1978]An Act to provide for the levy and collection of
