### 1909.

S.O. 2251, dated the 9th May, 1977. - Whereas the Central Government has
prescribed, under the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Grain) Rules, 19742,
certain fittings and provisions as "necessary and reasonable precautions", or
the purposes of section 332 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958),
to be followed by :-(a)all Indian ships, and(b)ships other than Indian
ships(i)when they are loaded with grain at any port or place in India or
within the territorial water of India, or(ii)when they enter any port or place
in India or come within the territorial waters of India laden with grain;And
whereas the Central Government is otherwise satisfied that the fittings
provisions, recommended by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organisation and set out in Appendices I and II to this Order are as effective
as those required by the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Grain) Rules, 1974;And
Whereas the Central Government considers it expedient to permit the
alternative fittings or provisions set out in the said Appendices I and H to
this Order, be fitted or made in any of the ships aforesaid;Now, therefore, in
exercise of the powers conferred by section 454A of the Merchant Shipping Act,
1958 (44 of 1958); the Central Government hereby makes the following Order,
namely :-

### 1. Short title and commencement.

(1)This Order may be called the Merchant Shipping (Equivalent Arrangements for
Carriage of Grain) Order, 1977.(2)It shall come into force on the date of its
publication in the Official Gazette.

### 2. Equivalent arrangements for carriage of grain.

\- A ship to which the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Grain) Rules, 1974,
apply may, instead of complying with the requirements of the said rules comply
with the requirements specified in either Appendix I or Appendix II to this
Order :Provided that no such ship shall be permitted to comply(i)partly with
the requirements specified in the said rules and partly with the requirements
specified in any of the said two Appendices;(ii)party with the requirements
specified in the said Appendix I and partly with requirements specified in the
said Appendix II.Appendix IEquivalent arrangements to those prescribed in the
Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Grain) Rules, 1974.Definitions :

### 1\. In this Appendix, unless the context otherwise requires, the following
expressions have the following meanings respectively :

"Compartment" |  meansa hold or a cargo space bounded by bulkheads at each end andhaving decks above and below.  
---|---  
"Filledcompartment" |  meansany compartment in which after loading and trimming the level ofthe bulk grain is as high as possible.  
"Partlyfilled compartment" |  meansany compartment loaded with bulk grain not being a filledcompartment.  
"Grain" |  includeswheat, maize, oats, rye, barley, rice pulses and seeds.  
"Metacentricheight" |  meansthe distance between the transverse metacentre (M) and thecentre of gravity (G) corrected for the free effects of liquidsin tanks.  
"Schedule" |  meansa Schedule in this Appendix.  
"Shiftingboards" |  meansshifting boards constructed in accordance with the requirementsof (B) Part I. Schedule II of this Appendix.  
  
Trimming :

### 2\. (a) All necessary and reasonable trimming should be performed to
minimize the effect of grain shifting. In any compartment which is filled with
bulk grain, the grain should be trimmed so as to fill all the spaces : under
the decks and hatch covers to the maximum extent possible.

(b)After loading all free grain surfaces in partly filled compartments should
be trimmed level and the ship shall be upright when proceeding to sea.Intact
stability requirements :

### 3. (a) The intact stability characteristics of any ship carrying bulk
grain should be shown to meet, throughout the voyage, at least the following
criteria after taking into account in the manner described in Schedule I, the
heeling moments due to grain Shift:

(i)The angle of heel due to the shift of grain should be not greater than 12
degrees;(ii)in the statical stability diagram, the net or residual area
between the heeling arm curve and the righting arm curve up to the angle of
heel of maximum difference between the ordinates of the two curves, or 40
degrees or the angle of flooding.* whichever is the least, should in all
conditions of loading, be not less than 0.075 metreradians; and(iii)the
initial metacentric height, after correction for the free surface effects of
liquids in tanks, should be not less than 0.30 metres.Longitudinal divisions
and saucers :

### 4. (a) In both "filled" and "partly filled" compartments, longitudinal
divisions may be provided as a device either to refuse the adverse heeling
effect of grain shift or to limit the depth of cargo used for securing the
cain surface. Such divisions should be fitted grain-tight and constructed
accordance with the provisions of part I of Schedule II.

(b)In a "filled" compartment a division, if fitted, should extent downwards
from the underside of the deck or hatch covers to a distance below the deck
line of at least one-eight of the maximum breadth of the compartment. Except
in the case of oil seeds, a longitudinal division beneath of hatchway may be
replaced by a saucer of bagged grain or other suitable cargo, such a saucer
should be formed in the manner described in Part I of Schedule H.(c)In a
"partly filled" compartment, a division, if fitted should extend from one-
eight of the maximum breadth of the compartment above the level of the grain
surface and to the same distance below the grain surface. When used to limit
the depth of the cargo used for securing the height of the centreline division
should be not less than 0.61 metres above the grain surface.(d)Furthermore,
the adverse heeling effects of grain shift may be reduced by tightly stowing
the wings and ends of a compartment with bagged grain or other suitable cargo
adequately restrained from shifting.Securing :

### 5. (a) Unless account is taken of the adverse heeling effect due to grain
shift in accordance with these provisions, the surface of the bulk grain in
any "partly filled" compartment should be trimmed level and topped off with
bagged grain tightly stowed and extending to a height of not less than one-
sixteenth of the breadth of the free grain surface or 1.22 metres whichever is
the greater. Instead of bagged grain, other suitable cargo exerting at least
the same pressure may be used.

(b)The bagged grain or other suitable cargo should be supported in the manner
described in Part II of Schedule II. Alternatively, the bulk grain surface may
be secured by strapping or lashing as described in Part II of Schedule
II.Feeders and/or trunks :

### 6. If feeders and/or trunks are fitted proper account should be taken of
the effects thereof when calculating the heeling moments as described in Part
III of Schedule I. The strength of the divisions forming the boundaries of
such feeders shall conform with the provisions of Part I of Schedule II.

Combination arrangements :

### 7. Lower holds and tween deck spaces in way thereof may be loaded as one
compartment provided that, in calculating heeling moments, proper account is
taken of the flow of grain into the lower spaces.

Is an angle of heel at which openings in the hull, superstructures of
deckhouses, which cannot be closed weathertight, immerse. In applying this
definition, small openings through which progressive flooding cannot take
place need not be considered as open.

## I

Calculation of Assumed Heeling Moments

## Part I – Description of the assumed pattern of grain surface behaviour and
method of calculating intact stability.

## Part II – Determination of the assumed volumetric heeling moment of a
filled compartment.

## Part III – Feeders and trunks.

## Part IV – Partly filled compartments.

## Part I – Description of the assumed pattern of grain surface behaviour and
method of calculating intact stability.

(A)General.(a)For the purpose of calculating the stability of ships carrying
grain in bulk it should be assumed that :(i)In filled compartments of ships
with hatch side girder depths between 500 and 600 mm. the average depth of the
under deck void (Vd) is 460 mm.(ii)When the depth of the hatch side girder is
not between 500 and 600 mm, the average void depth shall be calculated
according to the formula.Vd = Vdl+0.75 (d-600) mm.where Vd = Average void
depth in mm;Vd1= Standard void depth from the Table I belowd = Actual girder
depth in mm.In no case shall Vd be assumed to be less than 100 mm.Table I

Distancefrom hatch end or hatch side to boundary of compartment metres |  Standardvoid depth VdI  
---|---  
0.5 | 570  
1 | 530  
1.5 | 500  
2 | 480  
2.5 | 450  
3 | 440  
3.5 | 430  
4 | 430  
4.5 | 430  
5 | 430  
5.5 | 450  
6 | 470  
6.5 | 490  
7 | 520  
7.5 | 550  
8 | 590  
  
(iii)No voids will exist surfaces whose inclination to the horizontal is 30
degrees or greater.(iv)Within filled hatches there is an average void depth of
75 mm measured from the lower part of the hatch cover to the grain surface. If
the hatchway is not completely filled this void in combination with any other
void arising from incomplete filling of the hatch should be used in
calculating the assumed heeling moments.(b)The ship's stability calculations
should be based upon the assumption that the centre of gravity of the cargo is
at the volumetric centre of the whole cargo space and in such cases it will be
necessary only to calculate the adverse heeling moment due to transverse
shifts of grain. However, if it is considered necessary to take into account
the reduction in the ship's vertical centre of gravity due to the existence of
the under deck voids when calculating the ships righting arm curve, the net
effects of the vertical component shifts of grain should also be included in
the total assumed heeling moment curve (see Fig. 1).Figure 1where :no =
assumed volumetric heeling moment due to transverse shift

cargo.Displacement = Weight of ship, fuel fresh water, stores, etc. and
cargo.The total assumed heeling moment curve can be approximately represented
by the straight line through A and B whose ordinance are :OA = and PB = (40 +
0.66) respectively.

## Part II – Determination of the assumed volumetric heeling movement of a
filled compartment.

(A)General(a)The methods described hereunder should be used to determine the
assumed volumetric heeling moment per unit length.(b)In the figures the
moments are calculated in accordance with the change in shape and/or position
of voids.(c)The angle of surface shift of the bulk grain (or wedge angle) is
assumed to be 15 degrees.Note : When the final centroid of the void is higher
or lower than its initial centroid, the vertical volumetric heeling moment has
to be respectively subtracted or added.(B)Forwarded of and abaft the
hatchway.(a)With centre line division (see Fig. 2)Figure 2Assumed horizontal
volumetric heeling moment = A × X × 2 for both sides.Assumed vertical
volumetric heeling moment= A × Y × 2 for both sides.Where X = Transverse shift
of centre of void due to change of space, andY = Vertical shift of centre of
void due to change of shape.(b)Without centre line division (see Fig. 3).(i)If
the effect of the under deck longitudinal girders is to be taken into account,
the moments should be calculated according to the pattern of grain behaviour
shown in Fig. 3.Formulae : (1) = (AB × VD)-Vr where Vr = d2/2 tan 15°(2)= (BC
× Vd)-Vr(3)=CD × VdAssumed horizontal volumetric heeling moment =((1) × X1)+
((2) × X2)+((3) × X1)Assumed vertical volumetric heeling moment =((1) × Y1)+
((2) × Y2)+((3) × Y2)(ii)If the effect of longitudinal girders is not to be
taken into account the moment should be calculated in the same manner as
described in (B)(a) above where B/2 becomes-B in the calculations.(C)Abreast
the hatchway.(a)When there is a centre line division in the hatchway (see Fig.
4).Formulae : (1) = (AB × VD)-Vr where Vr = d²/22 tan 15°(2)= CD × Vd(3)= (4)
= 1/2 × BC × Vdo(1)transfers to the centroid of the final void on the low side
of the hatchway.(3)transfers to the centred of the final void on the low side
of the hatchway.(2)(4) transfer from rectangular to triangular shapes.Assumed
horizontal volumetric heeling moment =((1) × X1)+((2) × X2)+((3) × X3)+((4) ×
X4)Assumed vertical volumetric heeling moment =((1) × Y1)+ ((2) × Y2)+((3) ×
Y3)+((4) × Y4)(b)When there is no centre line division in the hatchway. The
calculation should be similar to that in (C) (a) above except that the
transverse lever X1 will increase due to the formation of the void against the
girder at C instead of against the centre line division and (3) and (4) will
combine to form a single initial void.(D)Multiple decks in association with
combination arrangements of loading.(a)No deck perforations(i)Except where
included in a pattern of deck performations accepted by the Departments, it is
considered that trimming hatches of normal dimensions, even though open, have
no significant effect in reducing the volume of the under deck voids.(ii)Two
deck arrangement without centre line divisions (see Fig. 5).Figure 5The
transfer of voids in this arrangement shall be assumed to have taken place as
follows:(1)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the weather deck
hatch cover;(2)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the weather
deck on the high side;½ of (3) transfers to the final void under the weather
deck hatch cover;¼ of (3) transfers to the final void under the weather deck
on the high side;¼ of (3) transfers to the final void under the second deck on
the high side;(4)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the second
deck on the high side;(5)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the
weather deck hatch cover;Where:

(1) = (AB x Vd1)-Vr1, where Vr1=| d122 tan 15  
---  
  
(2)= VD × Vd1

(3) = (EF × Vd2)-Vr2, where Vr2 =| d212 tan 15  
---  
  
(4)= GH × Vd2(5)= BC × VdoThe volume of the final void under the weather deck
hatch cover will be (5) plus (1) plus ½ of (3) and its centroid positioned
accordingly.The volume of the final void under the weather deck on the high
side will be (2) plus ¼ of (3) and its centroid positioned accordingly.The
volume of the final void under the second deck on the high side will be(4)
plus/¼ of (3) and its centroid positioned accordingly.(iii)Two deck
arrangement with tween deck centreline division (see Fig. 6).The transfer of
voids in this arrangement should be assumed to have taken place as shown in
Fig. 6 which follows the principles outlined in (D) (a) (ii) above except that
the presence of the centreline division will reduce the transverse shift of
(1) and part of (3).(iv)Three deck arrangement (see Fig. 7).The transfer of
voids in this arrangement should be assumed to have taken place as
follows(1)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the weather deck
hatch cover;(2)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the weather
deck on the high side;½ of (3) transfers to the final void under the weather
deck hatch cover;¼ of (3) transfers to the final void under the weather deck
on the high side;¼ of (3) transfers to the final void under the second deck on
the high side;(4)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the second
deck on the high side;¼ of (5) transfers to the final void under the weather
deck hatch cover;¼ of (5) transfers to the final void under the weather deck
on the high side;¼ of (5) transfers to the final void under the second deck on
the high side;¼ of (5) transfers to the final void under the third deck on the
high side;(6)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the third deck
on the high side;(7)transfers to the centroid of the final void under the
weather deck hatch cover;Where :

(1) = (AB × Vd1)-Vr1, where Vr1=| d122 tan 15  
---  
  
(2)=CD×Vd1

(3) = (EF × Vd2)-Vr2, where Vr2=| d122 tan 15  
---  
  
(4)= GH × Vd2

(5) = (JK × Vd3)-Vr3, where Vr3=| d122 tan 15  
---  
  
(6)= LM × Vd1(7)= BC × Vd2The volume of the final void under the weather deck
hatch cover will be (7) + (1) + 1/2 of (3) + 1/4 of (5) and its centroid
positioned accordingly.The volume of the final void under the weather deck on
the high side will be (2) plus 1/4 of [(3)+(5)] and its centroid positioned
accordingly.The volume of the final void under the second deck on the high
side will be (4) plus 1/4 of [(3) + (5)] and its centroid positioned
accordingly.The volume of the final void under the third deck on the high side
will be (6) +'A of (5) and its centroid positioned accordingly.(v)Further
multiple deck arrangements.For such arrangements it should be assumed that the
voids on the low side under each additional deck are equally distributed to
all the voids on the high side. For example, if a fourth deck was added to
fig. 7 the void on the low side under the deck would be assumed to be equally
transferred to each of the five voids on the high side (viz. hatchway, weather
deck second deck, third deck and fourth deck respectively.).(b)With deck
perforations :(i)Where decks are perforated the voids under such decks will be
reduced during loading. The percentage of the original voids remaining should
be obtained from Fig. 12.Figure 12Figure 12(ii)Under the influence of ship
motion it may be assumed that these voids are eventually completely filled
transversely between perforations. The Department should be satisfied that
these perforations are so distributed throughout the longitudinal extent of
the deck as to achieve effective void filling. The heeling moments should be
calculated in the manner described in (a) above with due regard to the
increase in volume of the higher voids and any voids remaining under the
perforated deck.

## Part III – Feeders and trunks

(A)Suitably placed wing feeders (See Fig. 8).Figure 8It may be assumed that
under the influence of ship motion under deck voids will be substantially
filled by the flow of grain from a pair of longitudinal feeders
providedthat-(1)the feeders extend for the full length of the deck, and that
the perforations therein are adequately spaced;(2)the volume of each feeder is
equal to the volume of the under deck void out-board of the hatch side girder
and its continuation.(B)Trunks situated over main hatchways (see Fig. 9)Figure
9The transfer of voids in this arrangement should be assumed to have taken
place as follows:(1)Transfers to the centroid of the final void against the
trunk side;(2)Transfers to the centroid of the final void under the weather
deck on the high side;

### 2\.

/3 of (3) transfers to the bottom of the trunk on the centreline;

### 1\.

/3 of (3) transfers to the void under the second deck on the high
side;(4)Transfers to the centroid of the final void under the second deck on
the high side.Where :(1)= AB1 Vd1(2)= CDz Vd1

(3) = (EFxVd2)-Vr2, where Vr2=| dz22 tan 15  
---  
  
(4)= GHz Vd2The volume of the final void under the second deck on the high
side will be (4) plus 1/3 of (3) and its centroid positioned
accordingly.Within the frunk itself the heeling moment should be assumed to be
that arising from a full wedge transfer of 25 degrees.Where a trunk is
situated over lower between decks the assumed pattern of void transfers should
be in accordance with the principles of Part 11(D)(a)(ii), (iii) or NO of this
Schedule.

## Part IV – Partly Filled Compartments

(A)General.When the free surface of the bulk grain has not been secured in
accordance with Section 5 of the Appendix it should be assumed that a transfer
takes place over all surfaces with an angle of surface shift (wedge angle) of
25 degrees.(B)Discontinuous longitudinal divisions.In a compartment in which
the longitudinal divisions are not continuous between the transverse
boundaries, the length over which any such divisions are effective as devices
to prevent full width shifts of grain surfaces, should be taken to be the
actual length of the portion of the division under consideration less two-
sevenths of the greater of the two transverse distances between the division
and the adjacent division or ships side (see Figs. 10 and 11.).Figure 10Figure
11Figure 12The word "space" occurring in foot-note below diagram should read
as "spacing".

## II

## Part I – Strength of grain fittings.

(A)General (including working stresses).(B)Divisions loaded on both
sides.(C)Divisions loaded on one side only.(D)Saucers.

## Part II – Securing of partly filled compartments

(A)Strapping or lashing.(B)Constructional details of securing
arrangements.(C)Bagged grain.

## Part I – Strength of Grain Fittings

(A)General :(a)Timber. - All timber used for grain fittings should be of good
sound quality and of a type and grade which has been proved to be satisfactory
for this purpose. The actual finished dimensions of the timber should be in
accordance with the dimensions herein after specified in this Schedule.
Plywood of an exterior type bonded with water-proof glue and fitted so that
the direction of the grain in the face plies is parpendicular to the
supporting uprights or binder may be used provided that its strength is
equivalent to that of solid timber of the appropriate scantlings.(b)Working
stresses. - When calculating the dimensions of divisions loaded on one side,
using the Tables in paragraphs (c), (a) and (b) of this Part of the Schedule,
the following working stresses should be adopted.

Fordivisions of steel |  2,000Kg. per square cm.  
---|---  
Fordivisions of wood |  160Kg. per square cm.  
  
(c)Other materials. - Materials other than wood or steel, may be approved for
such divisions provided, that proper regard has been paid to their mechanical
properties.(d)Uprights. - (i) Unless means are provided to prevent the ends of
uprights being dislodged from their sockets, the depth of housing at each end
of each upright should be not less than 75 mm. If an upright is not secured at
the top the uppermost shore or stay should be fitted as near thereto as is
practicable.(ii)The arrangements provided for inserting shifting boards by
removing a part of the crow-section of an upright should be such that the
local level of stresses is not unduly high.(iii)The maximum bending moment
imposed upon an upright supporting a division loaded on one side should
normally be calculated assuming that the ends of the uprights are freely
supported. However, if the Department are satisfied that any degree of fixity
assumed will be achieved in practice, account may be taken of any reduction in
the maximum bending moment arising from any degree of fixity providedat the
ends of the upright.(e)Composite sections. - Where uprights, binders, or any
other strength members are formed by two separate sections one fitted on each
side of a division and inter-connected by through bolts at adequate spacing,
the effective section modulus should be taken as the sum of the two moduli of
the separate sections.(f)Partial division. - Where divisions do not extend to
the full depth of the hold, such divisions and their uprights should be
supported or stayed so as to be as efficient as those which do extend to the
full depth of the hold.(B)Divisions loaded on both sides.(a)Shifting boards. -
(i) Shifting boards should have a thickness of not less than 50 mm and should
be fitted grain-tight and where necessary supported by uprights.(ii)The
maximum unsupported span for shifting boards of various thickness should be as
follows :

Thickness |  Maximumunsupported span  
---|---  
50mm |  2.5metres  
60mm |  3.0metres  
70mm |  3.5metres  
80mm |  4.0metres  
  
If thickness greater than these are provided the maximum unsupported span
should vary in direct proportion with the increase in thickness.(iii)The ends
of all shifting boards should be securely housed with 75 mm minimum bearing
length.(b)Other materials.-Divisions formed by using materials other than wood
should have a strength equivalent to the shifting boards required in (B) (a)
above.(c)Uprights. - (i) Steel uprights used to support divisions loaded on
both sides should have a section modulus given by W = a, W1Where :W = Section
modulus in cm³a = Horizontal span between uprights in metres.The section
modulus per metres span W1 should be not less than that given bythe formula
:W1 = 14.8 (hr.-1.22) cm³ per metre;h1 is the vertical unsupported span in
metres and should be taken as the maximum value of the distance between any
two adjacent stays or between the stay or either end of the upright. Where
this distance is less than 2.44 metres the respective modulus shall be
calculated as if the actual value was 2.44 metres.(ii)The moduli of wood
uprights should be determined by multiplying by 12.7 the corresponding moduli
for steel uprights. If other materials are used their moduli should be at
least that required for steel increased in proportion to the ratio of the
permissible stresses for steel to that of the material used. In such cases
attention should be paid also to the relative rigidity of each upright to
ensure that the deflection is not excessive.(iii)The horizontal distance
between uprights should be such that the unsupported spans of the shifting
boards do not exceed the maximum span specified in paragraph (a)(ii) of this
Part of the Schedule.(d)Shores. - (i) Wood shores, when used, should be in a
single piece and should be securely fixed at each end and heeled against the
permanent structure of the ship except that they shall not bear directly
against the side plating of the ship.(ii)Subject to the provisions of sub-
paragraphs (iii) and (iv) the minimum size of wood shores shall be as follows
:

Lengthof Shoremetres |  Rectangularsectionmm |  Diameterof circular sectionmm  
---|---|---  
Notexceeding 3 m |  150x 100 | 140  
Over3 m but not exceeding 5 m |  150x 150 | 165  
Over5 m but not exceeding 6 m |  150x 150 | 180  
Over6 m but not exceeding 7 m |  200x 150 | 190  
Over7 m but not exceeding 8 m |  200x 150 | 200  
Exceeding8 m |  200x 150 | 215  
  
Shores of 7 metres or more in length should be securely bridged at
approximately mid-length.(iii)When the horizontal distance between the
uprights differs significantly from 4 metres, the moments of inertia of the
shores may be changed in direct proportion.(iv)Where the angle of the shore to
the horizontal exceeds 10 degrees the next larger shore to that required by
sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph should be fitted provided that in no case
shall the angle between any shore and the horizontal exceed 45
degrees.(e)Stays. - Where stays are used to support divisions loaded on both
sides, they should be fitted horizontally or as near thereto as practicable,
well secured at each end and formed of steel wire rope. The sizes of the wire
rope should be determined assuming that the divisions and upright which the
stay supports is uniformly loaded at 500 kg/m2. The working load so assumed in
the stay should not exceed one-third of its breaking load.(C)Divisions, loaded
on one side only.(a)Longitudinal divisions. - The loan in Kg. per metre length
of the divisionshould be taken to be as follows:TABLE I [*] [For the purpose
of converting the above loads into British units (ton/ft) 1 kg. per metre
length should be taken to be equivalent to 0.0003 tons per foot length]

h = height of grain in metres [**] [There the distance from a division to a
feeder or hatchway is I metre the height should be taken to the level of the
grain within that hatchway or feeder. In all other cases the height should be
taken to the overhead deck in way of the division.]B = transverse extent of
the bulk grain in metres.For other value of h and/or B the loads should be
determined by linear interpolation or extrapolation as necessary.(b)Transverse

L = Longitudinal extent of the bulk grain.For other value of h and/or L the
reactions loads shall be determined by linear interpolation or extrapolation
as necessary.The strength of the end connections of such vertical members or
uprights may be calculated on the basis of the maximum load likely to be
imposed at either end. These loads are as follows :

Maximumload at the top. |  50%of the appropriate total load from Table I.  
---|---  
LongitudinalDivisions |   
Maximumload at the bottom |  55%of the appropriate total load from Table I.  
Maximumload at the top. |  45%of the appropriate total load from Table II.  
TransverseDivisions |   
Maximumload at the bottom |  60%of the appropriate total load from Table H.  
  
The thickness of horizontal wooden boards may also be determined having regard
to the vertical distribution of the loading represented by Tables III and IV
above and in such cases :Where :t = Thickness of board in mm;a = Horizontal
span of the board, i.e., distance between uprights in metresh = Head of grain
to the bottom of the divisions in metres;p = Total load per unit length
derived from Table I or II in kg.k = Factor dependent upon vertical
distribution of the loading.When the vertical distribution of the loading is
assumed to be uniform, i.e., rectangular, k should be taken as equal to
1.0.For a trapezoidal distribution.k = 1.0 + 0.06 (50-R), whereR is the upper
end bearing reaction taken from Table III or IV.(d)Stays or shores. - The
sizes of stays and shores should be so determined that the loads derived from
Tables I and II in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b) should not exceed one-
third of the breaking loads.(D)Saucers.When a saucer is used to reduce the
heeling moments in a full compartment, its depth measured from the bottom of
the saucer to the deck line, should be as follows :For ships with a moulded
breadth of up to 9.14 metres not less than 1.22 metres.For ships with a
moulded breadth of up to 18.29 metres or more, not less than 1.83 metres.For
ships with a moulded breadth between 9.14 metres and 18.29 metres, theminimum
depth of the saucer should be calculated by interpolation.As far as is
practicable the top (mouth) of the saucer should be formed by the under deck
structure in the way of the hatchway, i.e., hatch side girders or coamings and
hatch end beams. The saucer and hatchway above should be completely filled
with bagged grain or other suitable cargo laid down on a separation cloth or
its equivalent and stowed tightly against adjacent structures and the portable
hatchway beams if the latter are in place.

## Part II – Securing or Partly filled Compartments

(A)Strapping or lashing.(a)When, in order to eliminate heeling moments in
partly filled compartments, strapping or lashing is utilised, the securing
should be accomplished as follows :-(i)The grain should be trimmed and
levelled to the extent that it is very slightly crowned and covered with
burlap separation cloths, tarpaulins or the equivalent.(ii)The separation
cloths and/or tarpaulins shall overlap at least 1.83 metres.(iii)Two solid
floors of 25 mm timber shall be laid with the top floor running longitudinally
and nailed to an athwarthships bottom floor. Alternately, one solid floor of
50 mm timber, running longitudinally and nailed over the top of a 50 mm bottom
bearer not less than 150 mm wide, may be used instead of the two floors of 25
mm timber. 'The bottom bearers should extend the full breadth of the
compartment and should be spaced not more than 2.44 metres apart. Arrangements
utilising other materials and considered by the Department to be equivalent to
the foregoing may be accepted.(iv)Steel wire (19 mm diameter or equivalent),
doubled strapping (50 mm x 1.3 mm) or chain, each having a breaking load of at
least 5,000 kg and set tight by means of a 32 mm turnbuckle, may be used for
lashings. A winch tightener, used in co-injunction with a locking arm, may be
substituted for the 32 mm turnbuckle when steel strapping is used, provided
suitable wrenches are available for setting up as necessary. When steel
strapping is used, not less than three crimp seals should be used for securing
the ends. When wire is used, not less than four clips should be used for
foming eyes in the lashings.(v)Prior to the completion of loading the lashing
should be positively attached to the framing at a point approximately 450 mm
below the anticipated final grain surface by means of either a 25 mm shackle
or beam clamp of equivalent strength.(vi)The lashings should be spaced not
more than 2.44 metres apart and each shall be supported by a bearer nailed
over the top of the fore and aft floor. This bearer should consist of not less
than 25 mm by 150 mm timber or its equivalent and should extend the full
breadth of the compartment.(B)Constructional details of securing
arrangements.Where bagged grain or other suitable cargo is utilised for the
purpose of securing partly filled compartments, the free grain surface should
be covered with a separation cloth or equivalent and/or by a suitable
platform. Such plateforms should consist of wooden bearers spaced not more
than 1.22 metres apart and 25 mm wooden boards laid thereon spaced not more
than 100 mm apart. Platforms may be constructed of other materials provided
they are considered by the Department to be equivalent.(C)Bagged grain.Bagged
grain shall be carried in sound bags which should be well filled and securely
closed.Appendix II(See Clause 2)Equivalent Arrangements to those prescribed in
the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Grain) Rules, 1974Part-I

## Part A – General Provisions

### 1\. Application. - Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Appendix,
including Parts A, B and C, applies to the carriage of grain in all ships to
which the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Grain) Rules, 1974 apply.

### 2\. Definitions.--

(a)The term "grain" includes wheat, maize (corn), oats, rye barley, rice,
pulses, seeds and processed forms thereof, whose behaviour is similar to that
of grain in its natural state.(b)The term "filled compartment" refers to any
compartment in which, after loading and trimming as required under para 3, the
bulk grain is at its highest possible level.(c)The term "partly filled
compartment" refers to any compartment wherein bulk grain is not loaded in the
manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this para.(d)The term "angle of
flooding" means an angle of heel at which openings in the hulls,
superstructures or deck-houses, which cannot be closed weathertight, immerse.
In applying this definition, small openings through which progressive flooding
cannot take place need not be considered as open.

### 3\. Trimming of Grain. - All necessary and reasonable trimming shall be
performed to level all free grains surfaces and to minimise the effect of
grain shifting.

(a)In any "filled compartment" the bulk grain shall be trimmed so as to fill
all the spaces under the decks and hatch covers to the maximum extent
possible.(b)After loading, all free grain surfaces in "partly filled
compartments" shall be level.(c)The Central Government may grant dispensation
from trimming in those cases where the under deck void geometry resulting from
flowing grain into a compartment, which may be provided with feeding ducts,
perforated decks or other similar means, is taken into account to satisfaction
when calculating the void depths.

### 4\. Intact Stability Requirements. - (a) The calculations required by this
paragraph shall be based upon the stability information provided in accordance
with the Merchant Shipping (Cargo-ship Construction and Survey) Rules, 1974.

(b)The intact stability characteristics of any ship carrying bulk grain shall
be shown to meet, throughout the voyage, at least the following criteria after
taking into account in the matter described in Part B. the heeling moments due
to grain shift :(i)the angle of heel of the vessel due to the shift of grain
shall not be greater than 12 degrees except that the Central Government may
require a lesser angle of heel if it considers that experience shows this to
be necessary*;(ii)in the statical stability diagram, the net or residual area
between the heeling arm curve and the righting arm curve up to the angle of
heel of maximum difference between the ordinates of the two curves, or 40
degrees or the "angle of flooding (of)" whichever is the least, shall in all
conditions of loading be not less than 0.075 metres radians; and(iii)the
initial metacentric height, after correction for the free surface effects of
liquids in tanks, shall be not less than 0.30 metre.(c)Before loading bulk
grain the master shall, if so required by the Government of the country of the
port of loading, demonstrate the ability of the ship at all stages of any
voyage to comply with the stability criteria required by Sub-paragraph (b)
using the information approved and issued under paragraphs 10 and 11.(d)After
loading the master shall ensure that the ship shall be upright before
proceeding to sea.

### 5\. Longitudinal Divisions and Saucers. - (a) In both "filled
compartments" and "partly filled compartments," longitudinal divisions may be
provided as a device either to reduce the adverse heeling effect of grain
shift or to limit the depth of cargo used for securing the grain surface. Such
divisions shall be fitted grain-tight and constructed in accordance with the
provisions of Section I of the Part C.

For example, the permissible angle of heel might be limited to the angle of
feel at which the edge of the weather deck would be immersed in still
water.(b)In a "filled compartment," a division, if fitted to reduce the
adverse effects of grain shift shall;(i)in a tween deck compartment extend
from deck to deck; and(ii)in a hold extend downwards from the underside of the
deck of hatch covers as described in section II of Part B.Except in the case
of linseed and other seeds having similar properties, a longitudinal division
beneath a hatchway may be replaced by a saucer formed in the manner described
in section I of Part C.(c)In a "partly filled compartments," a division, if
fitted, shall extend from one-eight of the maximum breadth of the compartment
above the level of the grain surface and to the same distance below the grain
surface. When used to limit the depth of overs towing, the height of the
centreline division shall be at least 0.6 metre above the level grain,
surface.(d)Furthermore, the adverse heeling effects of grain shift may be
reduced by tightly stowing the wings and ends of a compartment with bagged
grain or other suitable cargo adequately restrained from shifting.

### 6\. Securing. - (a) Unless account is taken of the adverse heeling effect
due to grain shift in accordance with these provisions, the surface of the
bulk grain in any "partly filled compartment"shall be level and topped off
with bagged grain tightly stowed and extending to a height of not less than
one-sixteenth of the maximum breadth of the free grain surface or 1.2 metres,
whichever is the greater, instead of bagged grain, other suitable cargo
exerting at least the same pressure may be used.

(b)The bagged grain or such other suitable cargo shall be supported in the
manner described in section II of Part C. Alternatively, the bulk grain
surface may be secured by strapping or lashing as described in section II of
Part C.

### 7\. Feeders and Trunks. - If feeders or trunks are fitted proper account
shall be taken of the effect thereof when calculating the heeling moments as
described in section III of Part B. The strength of the divisions forming the
boundaries of such feeders shall conform with the provisions of section I of
Part C.

### 8. Combination Arrangements. - Lower holds and tween deck spaces in way
thereof may be loaded as one compartment provided that in calculating
transverse heeling moments, proper account is taken of the flow of grain into
the lower spaces.

### 9. Application of Parts B and C. - The Central Government may authorize
departure from the assumptions contained in Parts B and C in those cases where
it considers this to be justified having regard to the provisions for loading
or the structured arrangements, provided the stability criteria in Part 4(b)
are met. Where such authorisation is granted under this para. all particulars
shall be included in the grain loading data.

### 10. Authorisation. - (a) A document of authorisation shall be issued for
every ship loaded in accordance with this appendix.

(b)The document shall accompany and refer to the grain loading stability
booklet provided to enable the master to meet the requirements of Paragraph
4(c). This booklet shall meet the requirements of Para 11.(c)A copy of such a
document, grain loading stability data and associated plan shall be placed on
board in order that the master, if so required, shall produce them for the
inspection of the Government of the country of the port of loading.(d)A ship
without such a document of authorisation shall not load grain until the master
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Central Government or the Government
of the port of loading on behalf of the Central Government that the ship in
its proposed loaded condition will comply with the requirements of this
Appendix.

### 11. Grain Loading Information. - This information shall be sufficient to
allow the master to determine in all reasonable loading conditions the heeling
moments due to grain shift calculated in accordance with Part B. It shall
include the following :

(a)Information which shall be approved by the Central Government :(i)Curves of
tables of grain heeling moments for every compartment, filled or partly filled
or combination thereof, including the effects of temporary fittings;(ii)tables
of maximum permissible heeling moments or other information sufficient to
allow the master to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Paragraph
4(c);(iii)details of the scantlings of any temporary fittings and where
applicable the provisions necessary to meet the requirements of section I(E)
of Part C.(iv)typical loaded service departure and arrival conditions and
where necessary, intermediate worst service conditions;(v)a worked example for
the guidance of the master;(vi)loading instructions in the form of notes
summarizing the requirements of this Appendix.(b)Information which shall be
acceptable to the Central Government :-(i)ship's particulars;(ii)lightship
displacement and the vertical distance from the intersection of the moulded
base line and midship section of the centre of gravity (KG);(iii)table of free
surface corrections;(iv)capacities and centres of gravity.Part-B--Calculation
of Assumed Heeling Moments Section I-Description of the assumed voids and
method of calculating intact stability.(A)General(a)For the purpose of
calculating the adverse heeling moment due to a shift of cargo surface in
ships carrying bulk grain it shall be assumed that :(i)In "filled
compartments" which have been trimmed in accordance with Para 3 avoid exists
under all boundary surfaces having an inclination to the horizontal less than
30 degrees and that the void is parallel to the boundary surface having an
average depth calculated according to the formula :Vd = Vd1+0.75 (d-600)
mm.WhereVD = Average void depth in mm;Vd1 = Standard void depth from Table I
below;d = Actual girder depth in mm.In no case shall Vd be assumed to be less
than 100 mm.Table I

Notes on Table IFor distances greater than 8.0 metres the standard void depth
Vd1 shall be linearly extrapolated at 80 mm increase for each 1.0 metre
increase in distance. Where there is a difference in depth between the
hatchside girder or its continuation and the hatched beam the greater depth
shall be used except that :(1)when the hatchside girder or its continuation is
shallower than the hatched beam the voids abreast the hatchway may be
calculated using the lesser depth; and(2)when the hatched beam is shallower
than the hatchside girder or its continuation the voids fore and aft of the
hatchway inboard of the continuation of the hatchside girder may be calculated
using the lesser depth;(3)where there is a raised deck clear of a hatchway the
average void depth measured from the underside of the raised deck shall be
calculated using the standard void depth in association with the girder depth
of the hatched beam plus the height of the raised deck.(ii)In "filled
compartments" which are not trimmed in accordance with paragraph 3 and where
the boundary surface has an inclination to the horizontal which is less than
30 degrees, the cargo surface has an inclination of 30 degrees to the
horizontal after loading.(iii)Within filled hatchways and in addition to any
open void within the hatch cover there is a void of average depth of 150 mm
measured down to the grain surface from the lowest part of the hatch cover or
the top of the hatchside coaming, whichever is the lower.(b)The description of
the pattern of grain surface behaviour to be assumed in "partly filled
compartments" is shown in section IV of this Part.(c)For the purpose of
demonstrating compliance with the stability criteria in paragraph 4(b) (see
Figure 1), the ships stability calculations shall be normally passed upon the
assumption that the centre of gravity of cargo in a "filled compartment" is at
the volumetric centre of the whole cargo space. In those cases where the
Central Government authorises account to be taken of the effect of assumed
underdeck voids on the vertical position of the centre of gravity of the cargo
in "filled compartments" it will be necessary to compensate for the adverse
effect of the vertical shift of grain surface by increasing the assumed
heeling moment due to the transverse shift of grain as follows :Total heeling
moment = 1.06 × calculated transverse heeling moment.In all cases the weight
of cargo in a "filled compartment" shall be the volume of the whole cargo
space divided by the stowage factor.(d)In "partly filled compartments" the
adverse effect of the vertical shift of grain surfaces shall be taken into
account as follows :(e)Total heeling moment =1.12 × calculated transverse
heeling moment.(f)Any other equally effective method may be adopted to make
the compensation required in paragraphs (c) and (d) above.Notes on Figure 1

compartment(A)General(a)The pattern of grain surface moment relates to a
transverse section across the portion of the compartment being considered and
the resultant heeling moment should be multiplied by the length to obtain the
total moment for that portion.(b)The assumed transverse heeling moment due to
grain shifting is a consequence of final changes of shape and position of
voids after grain has moved from the high side to the low side.(c)The
resulting grain surface after shifting shall he assumed to be at 15 degrees to
the horizontal.(d)In calculating the maximum void area that can be formed
against a longitudinal structural member, the effects of any horizontal
surfaces, e.g. flanges or face bars, shall be ignored.(e)The total areas of
the initial and final voids shall be equal.(f)A discontinuous longitudinal
division shall be considered effective over its full length.(B)AssumptionsIn
the following paragraphs it is assumed that the total heeling moment for a
compartment is obtained by adding the results of separate considerations of
the following portions;(a)Before and abaft hatchways;(i)If a compartment has
two or more main hatchways through which loading may take place the depth of
the underdeck void for the portion (s) between such hatchways shall be
determined using the fore and aft distance to the midpoint between the
hatchways.(ii)After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be
as shown in Figure 2 below :-Notes on figure 2

### 1\. If the maximum void area which can be formed against the girder at B
is less than the initial area of the void under AB, i.e., AB x Vd, the excess
area shall be assumed to transfer to the final void on the high side.

### 2\. If the longitudinal division at C is one which has been provided in
accordance with Paragraph 5(b)(ii) it shall extend to at least 0.6 m below D
or E whichever gives the greater depth.

(b)In and abreast hatchways:After the assumed shift of grain the final void
pattern shall be as shown in the following Figure 3 or Figure 4.(1)AB any area
in excess of that which can be formed against the girder at B shall transfer
to the final void area in the hatchway.(2)CD any area in excess of that which
can be formed against the girder at E shall transfer to the final void area in
the high side.Notes on Figure 4(1)If the centreline division is one which has
been provided in accordance with Paragraph 5(b)(ii) it shall extend to at
least 0.6 m below H or J whichever gives the greater depth.(2)The excess void
area from AB shall transfer to the low side half of the hatchway in which two
separate final void areas will be formed viz. one against the centreline
division and the other against the hatchside coaming and girder on the high
side.(3)If a bagged saucer or bulk bundle is formed in a hatchway it shall be
assumed for the purpose of calculating transverse heeling moment, that such a
device is at least equivalent to centreline division.(4)Compartments Loaded in
CombinationThe following paragraphs describe the pattern of void behaviour
which shall be assumed when compartments are loaded in combination :(a)Without
effective centreline divisions :(i)Under the upper deck-as for the single deck
arrangement described in Section II(B) of this Part.(ii)Under the second deck-
the area of void available for transfer from the low side, i.e., original void
area less area against the hatchside girder, shall be assumed to transfer as
follows :one half to the upper deck hatchway and one quarter each to the high
side under the upper and second deck.(iii)Under the third and lower decks-the
void areas available for transfer from the low side of each of these decks
shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to all the voids under the
decks on the high side and the void in the upper deck hatchway.(b)With
effective centreline divisions which extend into the upper deck hatchway:(i)At
all deck levels abreast the division the void areas available for transfer
from the low side shall be assumed to transfer to the void under the low side
half of the upper deck hatchway.(ii)At the deck level immediately below the
bottom of the division the void area available for transfer from the low side
shall be assumed to transfer as follows:one half to the void under the low
side half of the upper deck hatchway and the remainder in equal quantities to
the voids under the decks on the high side.(iii)At deck levels lower than
those described in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) above the void area available
for transfer from the low side of each of those decks shall be assumed to
transfer in equal quantities to the voids in each of the two halves of the
upper deck hatchway on each side of the division and the voids under the decks
on the high side.(c)With effective centreline divisions which do not extend
into the upper deck hatchway:Since no horizontal transfer of voids may be
assumed to take place at the same deck level as the division the void area
available for transfer from the low side at this level shall be assumed to
transfer above the division to voids on the high sides in accordance with the
principles of paragraphs (a) and (b) above.Section III-Assumed Volumetric
Heeling moment of Feeders and Trunks(A)Suitably Placed Wing Feeders (See
Figure 5)It may be assumed that under the influence of ship motion underdeck
voids will be substantially filled by the flow of grain from a pair of
longitudinal feeders provided that:(a)the feeders extend for the full length
of the deck and that the perforations therein are adequately spaced;(b)the
volume of each feeder is equal to the volume of the under deck void outboard
of the hatchside girder and its continuation.(B)Trunks situated over Main
HatchwaysAfter the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be as
shown in Figure 6.Note on Figure 6If the wing spaces in way of the trunk
cannot be properly trimmed in accordance with Para 3 it shall be assumed that
a 25 degree surface shift takes place.Section IV-Assumed Volumetric Heeling
Moment of Partly Filled Compartments(A)GeneralWhen the free surface of the
bulk grain has not been secured in accordance with Para 6 it shall be assumed
that the grain surface after shirting shall at 25° to the
horizontal.(B)Discontinuous Longitudinal DivisionsIn a compartment in which
the longitudinal divisions are not continuous between the transverse
boundaries, the length over which any such divisions are effective as devices
to prevent full width shifts of grain surfaces shall be taken to be the actual
length of the portion of the division under consideration less two-sevenths of
the greater of the transverse distances between the division and its adjacent
division or ship side.This correction does not apply in the lower compartments
of any combination loading in which the upper compartment is either a "filled
compartment" or a "partly filled compartment".Section V - Alternative Loading
Arrangements for Existing Ships(A)GeneralA ship loaded in accordance with
either sub-section (B) or sub-section (C) below shall be considered to have
intact stability characteristics at least equivalent to the requirements of
Paragraph 4(b).For the purpose of this Part, the term "Existing Ship" means at
ship the keel of which is laid before the date of coming into force of this
Chapter.(B)Stowage of Specially Suitable Ships(a)Notwithstanding anything
contained in Part B of this Chapter, bulk grain may be carried without regard
to the requirements, specified therein in ships which are constructed with two
or more vertical or sloping grain tight longitudinal divisions suitably
disposed to limit the effect of any transverse shift of grain under the
following conditions :(i)as many holds and compartments as possible shall be
full and trimmed full :(ii)for any specified arrangement of stowage the ship
will not list to an angle greater than 5 degrees at any stage of the voyage
where :(1)in holds or compartments which have been trimmed full the grain
surface settled 2 per cent. by volume from the original surface and shifts to
an angle of 12 degrees with that surface under all boundaries of these holds
and compartments which have an inclination of less than 30 degrees to the
horizontal :(2)in "partly filled compartments or holds" free grain surfaces
settled and shift as in sub-paragraph (ii) (1) of this paragraph or to such
larger angle as may be deemed necessary by the Central Government and grain
surfaces if overstoyed in accordance with para 5 of this appendix shift to an
angle of 8 degrees with the original levelled surfaces. For the purpose of
sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph shifting boards, if fitted, will be
considered to limit the transverse shift of the surface of the grain :(iii)the
master is provided with a grain loading plan covering the stowage arrangements
to be adopted and a stability booklet both approved by the Central Government,
showing the stability conditions upon which the calculations given in sub-
paragraph (ii) of this paragraph are based.(b)Central Government shall
prescribe the precautions to be taken against shifting in all other conditions
of loading of ships designed in accordance with paragraph (B)(a) of this
section which meet the requirements of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of that
paragraph.(C)Ships Without Documents of AuthorisationA ship not having on
board documents of authorisation issued in accordance with paras 4 and 10 may
be permitted to load bulk grain under the requirements of sub-section (B)
above or provided that :(a)All "filled compartments" shall be fitted with
centreline divisions extending for the full length of such compartments which
extend downwards from the underside of the deck or hatch of the maximum
breadth of the compartment or 2.4 metres. whichever is the greater except that
saucers constructed in accordance with section II of Part C may be accepted in
lieu of a centreline division in and beneath a hatchway.(b)All hatches to
"filled compartments" shall be closed and covers secured in place.(c)All free
grain surfaces in "partly filled compartments" shall be trimmed level and
secured in accordance with section II of Part C.(d)Throughout the voyage the
metacentric height after correction for the free surface effects of liquids in
tanks shall be 0.3 metre or that given by the following formula, whichever is
the greater :Where :L = total combined length of all full compartments;B =
moulded breadth of vessel;SF = stowage factor;Vd = calculated average void
depth as per paragraph (a)(i) of section I(A) of thisPart;displacement.

## Part C – Grain Fittings and Securing Section I-Strength of Grain Fittings

(A)General :(a)Timber. - All timber used for grain fittings shall be of good
sound quality and of a type and grade which has been proved to be satisfactory
for this purpose. The actual finished dimensions of the timber shall be in
accordance with the dimensions hereinafter specified in this Part. Plywood of
an exterior type bounded with water-proof glue and fitted to that the
direction of the grain in the face plies is perpendicular to the supporting
uprights or binder may be used provided that its strength is equivalent to
that of solid timber of the appropriate scantlings.(b)Working stresses. - When
calculating the dimensions loaded on one side, using the Tables in paragraphs
(C),(a) and (b) of this Part the following working stresses should be adopted
:

Fordivisions of steel. |  2,000Kg. per square cm.  
---|---  
Fordivisions of wood |  160Kg. per square cm.  
  
(c)Other materials. - Materials other than wood or steel, may be approved for
such divisions provided, that proper regard has been paid to their mechanical
properties.(d)Uprights.(i)Unless means are provided to prevent the ends of
uprights being dislodged from their sockets, the depth of housing at each end
of each upright shall be not less than 75 mm. If an upright is not secured at
the top the super most shore or stay shall be fitted as near thereto as is
practicable.(ii)The arrangements provided for inserting shifting boards by
removing a part of the cross-section of an upright shall be such that the
local level of stresses is not unduly high.(iii)The maximum bending moment
imposed upon an upright supporting a division loaded on one side shall
normally be calculated assuming that the ends of the uprights are freely
supported. However, if the Central Government is satisfied that any degree of
fixity assumed will be achieved in practice, account may be taken of any
reduction in the maximum bending moment arising from any degree of fixity
provided at the ends of the upright.(e)Composite section. - Where uprights,
binders, or any other strength members are formed by two separate sections one
fitted on each side of a division and inter connected by through bolds at
adequate spacing, the effective section modules shall be taken as the sum of
the two moduli of the separate section.(f)Partial division. - Where divisions
do not extend to the full depth of the hold, such divisions and their uprights
shall be supported or stayed so as to be as efficient as those which do extend
to the full depth of the hold.(B)Divisions loaded on both sides.(a)Shifting
boards.(i)Shifting boards should have a thickness of not less than 50 mm and
shall be fitted grain-tight and where necessary supported by uprights.(ii)The
maximum unsupported span for shifting boards of various thickness shall be as
follows:

Thickness |  Maximumunsupported span  
---|---  
50mm |  2.5metres  
60mm |  3.0metres  
70mm |  3.5metres  
80mm |  4.0metres  
  
If thickness greater than these are provided the maximum unsupported span will
vary directly with the increase in thickness.(iii)The ends of all shifting
boards shall be securely boused with 75 mm minimum bearing length.(b)Other
materials. - Divisions formed by using materials other than wood shall have a
strength equivalent to the shifting boards required in paragraph (B) (a)
above.(c)Uprights.(i)Steel uprights used to support divisions loaded on both
sides shall have a section modulus given byW = a x W1Where :W = Section
modulus in cm3;a = horizontal span between uprights in metres.The Section
modulus per metre span W, shall be not less than that given by the formula :W1
= 14.8 (h1.-1.2) cm3; per metre;Where :h1 is the vertical unsupported span in
metres and shall be taken as the maximum value of the distance between any two
adjacent stays or between the say or either end of the upright. Where this
distance is less than 2.4 metres the respective modulus shall be calculated as
if the actual value was 2.4 metres.(ii)The moduli of wood uprights shall be
determined by multiplying by 12.5 the corresponding moduli for steel uprights.
If other materials are used their moduli shall be at least that required for
steel increased in proportion to the ratio of the permissible stresses for
steel to that of the material used. In such cases attention shall be paid also
to the relative rigidity of each upright to ensure that the deflection is not
excessive.(iii)The horizontal distance between uprights shall be such that the
unsupported spans of the shifting boards do not exceed the maximum span
specified in paragraph (B)(a)(ii) of this section.(d)Shores.(i)Wood shores,
when used, should be in a single piece and shall be securely fixed at each end
and heeled against the permanent structure of the ship except that they shall
not bear directly against the side plating of the ship.(ii)Subject to the
provision of sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below the minimum size of wood
shores shall be as follows :

Lengthof Shore in metres |  Rectangularsectionmm |  Diameterof circular sectionmm  
---|---|---  
Notexceeding 3 m |  150x 100 | 140  
Over3 m but not exceeding 5 m |  150x 150 | 165  
Over5 m but not exceeding 6 m |  150x 150 | 180  
Over6 m but not exceeding 7 m |  200x 150 | 190  
Over7 m but not exceeding 8 m |  200x 150 | 200  
Exceeding8 m |  200x 150 | 215  
  
Shores of 7 metres or more in length shall be securely bridged at
approximately mid-length.(iii)When the horizontal distance between the
uprights differs significantly from 4 metres, the moments of inertia of the
shores may be changed in direct proportion.(iv)Where the angle of the shore to
the horizontal exceeds 10 degrees the next larger shore to that required by
sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph should be fitted provided that in no case
shall the angle between any shore and the horizontal exceed 45
degrees.(e)Stays. - Where stays are used to support divisions loaded on both
sides, they shall be fitted horizontally or as near thereto as practicable
well secured at each end and formed of steel wire rope. The sizes of the wire
rope shall be determined assuming that the divisions and upright which the
stay supports are uniformly loaded at 500 kg/m&sub2;. The working load so
assumed in the stay shall not exceed one-third of its breaking
load.(C)Divisions, loaded on one side only.(a)Longitudinal divisions. - The
load in Kg. per metre length of the division shall be taken to be as
follows:TABLE I [*] [For the purpose of converting the above loads into
British units (ton/ft) 1 kg. per metre length should be taken to be equivalent
to 0.0003 ton per foot length]

L = Longitudinal extent of the bulk grain in metres.For other values of h or L
the reaction loads shall be determined by linear interpolation or
extrapolation as necessary.The strength of the end connections of such
vertical members of uprights may be calculated on the basis of the maximum
load likely to be imposed at eight end. These loads are as follows :

LongitudinalDivisions |   
---|---  
Maximumload at the top. |  50%of the appropriate total load from Table I.  
Maximumload at the bottom |  55%of the appropriate total load from Table I.  
TransverseDivisions |   
Maximumload at the top |  45%of the appropriate total load from Table 11.  
Maximumload at the bottom |  60%of the appropriate total load from Table 11.  
  
The thickness of horizontal wooden boards may also be determined having regard
to the vertical distribution of the loading.Represented by Tables III and IV
above and in such cases :Where :t = thickness of board in mm;a = horizontal
span of the board, i.e., distance between uprights in metres;h = head of grain
to the bottom of the division in metres;p = total load per unit length derived
from Table I or II in kg.k = factor dependent upon vertical distribution of
the loading.When the vertical distribution of the loading is assumed to be
uniform, i.e., rectangular, k shall be taken as equal to 1.0. For a
trapezoidal distribution.k = 1.0 + 0.06 (50-R), whereR is the upper end
bearing reaction taken from Table III or IV.(d)Stays or shores. - The sizes of
stays and shores shall be so determined that the loads derived from Tables I
and II in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not exceed one-third of
the breaking loads.(D)Saucers.When a saucer is used to reduce the heeling
moments in a filed compartment, its depth, measured from the bottom of the
saucer to the deck line, should be as follows:-For ships with a moulded
breadth of up to 9.1 metres not less than 1.2 metres.For ships with a moulded
breadth of upto 18.3 metres or more, not less than 1.8 metres.For ships with a
moulded breadth between 9.1 metres and 18.3 metres, the minimum depth of the
saucer should be calculated by interpolation.The top (mouth) of the saucer
shall be formed by the underdeck structure in the way of the hatchway, i.e.,
hatchside girders or coamings and hatch-end beams. The saucer and hatchway
above shall be completely filled with bagged grain or other suitable cargo
laid down on a separation cloth or its equivalent and stowed tightly against
adjacent structures and the port-table hatchway beams if the latter are in
place.(E)Bundling of BulkAs an alternative to filling the saucer with begged
grain or suitable cargo abundle of bulk grain may be used provided that
:(a)The saucer is lined with a material acceptable to the Central Government
having a tensile strength of not less than 274 kg per 5 cm strip and which is
provided with suitable means for securing at the top.(b)As an alternative to
paragraph (a) above a material acceptable to the Central Government having a
tensile strength of not less than 137 Kg per 5 cm strip may be used if the
saucer is constructed as follows :-Authwartship lashings shall be placed
inside the saucer formed in the bulk grain at intervals of not more than 2.4.
metres. These lashings shall be of sufficient length to permit being drawn up
light secured at the top of the saucer.Dunnage not less than 25 mm in
thickness or other suitable material of equal strength and between 150 to 300
mm in width shall be placed fore and aft over these lashings to prevent the
cutting or chafing of the material which shall be placed thereon to line the
saucer.(c)The saucer shall be filled with bulk grain and secured at the top
except that when using material approved under paragraph (h) above further
dunnage shall be laid on top after tapping the material before the saucer is
secured by setting up the lashings.(d)If more than one sheet of material is
used to line the saucer they shall be joined at the bottom either by sewing or
a double lap.(e)The top of the saucer shall be coincidental with the bottom of
the beams when these are in place and suitable general cargo or bulk grain may
be placed between the beams on top of the saucer.(F)Securing Hatch Covers of
Filled CompartmentIf there is no bulk grain or other cargo above a "filled
compartment" the hatch covers shall be secured in an approved manner having
regard to the weight and permanent arrangements provided for securing such
covers.The documents of authorisation issued under para 10 shall include
reference to the manner of securing considered necessary by the Central
Government.Section II-Securing or Partly filled Compartments(A)Strapping or
lashing.(a)When, in order to eliminate heeling moments in partly filled
compartments', strapping or lashing is utilised, the securing shall be
accomplished as follows-(i)The grain shall be trimmed and levelled to the
extent that it is very slightly crowned and covered with burlap separation
cloths, tarpaulins or the equivalent.(ii)The separation cloths and/or
tarpaulins shall overlap at least 1.83 metres.(iii)The solid floors of rough
25 mm by 150 mm to 300 mm lumber shall be laid with the top floor running
longitudinally and nailed to an athwartships bottom floor. Alternately, one
soid floor of 50 mm lumber, running longitudinally and nailed over the top of
a 50 mm bottom bearer not less than 150 mm wide, may be used. The bottom
bearers shall extend the full breadth of the compartment and shall be spaced
not more than 2.4 metres apart. Arrangements utilizing other materials and
deemed to be equivalent to the foregoing may be accepted.(iv)Steel wire (19 mm
diameter or equivalent), doubled steel strapping (50 mm x 1.3 mm and having a
breaking load of at least 5000 kg) or chain of equivalent strength, each of
which shall be set tight by means of a 32 mm turnbuckle, may be used for
lashings. A winch tightener, used in conjunction with a locking arm, may be
substituted for the 32 mm turnbuckle when steel strapping is used, provided
suitable wrenches are available for setting up as necessary. When steel
strapping is used, not less than three crimp seals shall be used for securing
the ends. When were is used, not less than four clips shall be used for foming
eyes in the lashings.(v)Prior to the completion of loading the lashing shall
be positively attached to the framing at a point approximately 450 mm below
the anticipated final grain surface by means of either a 25 mm shackle or beam
clamp of equivalent strength.(vi)The lashings shall be spaced not more than
2.4 metres apart and each shall be supported by a bearer nailed over the top
of the fore and aft floor. This bearer shall consist of not less than 25 mm by
150 mm lumber or its equivalent and shall extend the full breadth of the
compartment.(vii)During the voyage the strapping shall be regularly inspected
and set up where necessary.(B)Overstowing ArrangementsWhere bagged grain or
other suitable cargo is utilised for the purpose of securing "partly filled
compartments" the free grain surface shall be covered with a separation cloth
or equivalent or by a suitable platform. Such platforms shall consist of
bearers spaced not more than 1.2 metres apart and 25 mm boards laid there on
spaced not more than 100 mm apart. Platforms may be constructed of other
materials provided they are deemed to be equivalent.(C)Bagged GrainBagged
grain shall be carried in sound bages which shall be well filled and securely
closed.
