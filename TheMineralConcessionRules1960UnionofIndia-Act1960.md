mine owner, his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub-lessee shall
follow the following guidelines for computation of the amount or royalty on
minerals where the royalty is charged onad valorembasis, namely:-GuidelinesThe
guidelines for calculation of royalty in typical cases are as follows,
namely:-[Case 1: All non-atomic and non-fuel minerals and minerals other than
aluminium ] [Substituted by G.S.R. 329(E), dated 10.4.2003 (w.e.f. 10.4.2003).
][(bauxite and laterite despatched for use in alumina and aluminium metal
extraction)] [ Inserted by G.S.R. 153(E), dated 4.3.2005 (w.e.f. 4.3.2005).][,
primary gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, nickel and tin- [Substituted by
G.S.R. 329(E), dated 10.4.2003 (w.e.f. 10.4.2003). ]The Indian Bureau of Mines
publishes "Monthly Statistics of Mineral Production" which contains Statewise
total value of each mineral produced during a month in a State. The Statewise
average value for different individual minerals as published by Indian Bureau
of Mines in the "Monthly Statistics of Mineral Production" shall be the
benchmark for computation of royalty by the concerned State Government in
respect of any mineral produced any time during a month in any mine in that
State. For the purpose of computation of royalty the State Government shall
add twenty per cent. to this benchmark value. This value shall be reckoned to
be the sale price for the purpose of computation of royalty. Also the value of
the minerals published in the latest published issue of the "Monthly
Statistics of Mineral Production" will be deemed to be applicable for the
mineral mined in the previous month, irrespective of when the royalty actually
accrues. If for a particular mineral, the information for a State is not
published in a particular issue, the last information available for that
mineral in the State in a previous issue shall be referred, failing which the
latest published information for the mineral for all-India shall be
referred.Case 2: For atomic minerals, prescribed under Atomic Energy Act, 1962
(33 of 1962)-The minerals under this category include ilmenite, leucoxene,
rutile and zircon obtained mainly from the beach sand deposits in the coastal
States. The basis of collection of royalty shall be the actual mineral content
in the beach sand mined.(a) In case of sale in the domestic market, the per
tonne sale price of the separated mineral actually realized, less the cost of
transportation from the lease boundary to point of sale as shown by the mine
owners in their sale vouchers or bills or invoices shall be considered for
computingad valoremroyalty. To avoid payment of taxes on royalty the mine
owners in their own interest record the price and royalty separately in the
sale vouchers or bills or invoices instead of indicating a composite price
inclusive of royalty. In case the price, royalty and transportation cost are
not shown separately it shall be assumed that the price indicated in the sale
vouchers or bills or invoices is exclusive of royalty and transportation cost,
and royalty shall be charged accordingly.(b) In case of direct export be mine
owners the sale value for the purpose of royalty shall ordinarily be the free
on board (FOB) price realized less transportation charges from the lease
boundary to the port, loading and unloading charges at the port, port charges
(including sampling and analysis and demurrage charges, if any), insurance
charges, royalty, taxes and interest charges on loan for export. However, in
case of cost insurance and freight (CIF) sales, sea freight insurance and cost
of unloading at the destination port shall also be deducted form such price.
For such purposes the mine owner may prepare invoices or bills indicating the
free on board price or cost insurance freight price as the case may be and
each of the other charges separately.Explanation.-For the purposes of
calculation of royalty in case of minerals produced in captive mines (other
than aluminium ][(bauxite and laterite despatched for use in alumina and

total contained metal in the ore produced during the period for which the
royalty is computed and reported in the statutory returns under Mineral
Conservation and Development Rules, 1988 or recorded in the books of the mine
owners shall be considered for the purposes of computing the royalty in the
first place and then the royalty shall be computed as the percentage of the
average metal price in the London Metal Exchange (hereinafter referred to as
the LME) for copper, lead, zinc, nickel, silver and tin and London Bullion
Market Association price (commonly known as London price) for gold during the
period of computation of royalty. The foreign exchange rate for conversion of
rupees shall be the selling rate on the last date of the period of computation
as published in newspaper, namely, the Economic Times. For the LME prices as
well as for London price of the commodity, either of the following three
sources shall be referred to, namely:-{|

Case 4: For by-product gold and silverThe guidelines for computation ofad
valoremroyalty shall be linked to the total quantity of metal produced and the
LME price for silver and London Bullion Market Association price (commonly
known as London price) for gold as in the case 3 above. However, in this case,
the actual final production of the metal shall be considered instead of the
metal content in the ore produced for the purposes of computing royalty.[* *

production are the following, namely:-(i)Direct
cost:(a)Exploration(b)Beneficiation(ii)Over head
cost(iii)Depreciation(iv)Interest(v)Royalty(vi)Taxes(vii)Dead
rent(viii)Packing charges(ix)Research and development expenditureNote.-The
State Governments may, if necessary, introduce systems of advance payment for
the purpose of royalty collection and they may also impose any additional
conditions in accordance with the law for the time being in force.|}
