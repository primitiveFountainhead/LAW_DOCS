The Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920(5 of 1920)

### 068.

Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The object of this Bill is to amend the
Provincial Insolvency Act, 1907 (III of 1907), which contains the Law of
Insolvency in force in British India outside the Presidency towns and the town
of Rangoon. The Act came into force on the 1st January, 1908, and since then
with the exception of a few unimportant amendments made in 1914, it has not
been amended. Ten years' experience of the practical working of the Act has
brought to light many defects which have from time to time provoked criticism
from most of the local Governments and not a few of the Judges who have had to
administer its provisions. Numerous suggestions for the amendment of the Act
on various points have also been received from time to time from the
commercial communities and members of the legal profession.The chief
indictment of the Act is that it lends itself to the protection of fraudulent
debtors, that it subjects an undischarged insolvent to little or no practical
inconvenience, and that its provisions for the punishment of fraudulent
insolvents are not effective in practice.One of the principal defects in the
existing law arises from the fact that the conduct of debtor in many cases
never comes under the scrutiny of the Court. The stage at which the misconduct
of the debtor should come before the Court and at which most of the provisions
affecting a fraudulent insolvent would operate, is when he applies for his
discharge. But there is nothing in the Act which requires him to apply for his
discharge, and in practice such applications are rare. To remedy this
unsatisfactory state of the law, it is proposed to include in the Act
provisions which will compel an insolvent to apply to the Court within a
prescribed period for his discharge or to lose the protection afforded by the
insolvency proceedings. The Court will have power to extend the prescribed
period and, when the adjudication order is annulled owing to the failure of
the insolvent to apply in time for his discharge, a fresh petition on the same
facts will be barred. These proposed changes are affected by the proviso to
proposed new section 6-C in clause 4 of the Bill, new sub-section (1-A)(ii) in
clause 10, the amendments in clause 11(1), (3) and (4), and the amendments in
clause 20.It is now settled law that under the Act, as it stands, it is not
open to the Court to reject the petition of a debtor on the ground that the
application is an abuse of the law. While admitting that the object of an
insolvency law is to deal with all insolvents, whether honest or not and that
no applicant who is in fact insolvent should be liable to have his petition
dismissed in limine, it seems reasonable that the Court should have discretion
as to the amount of protection to be afforded to a petitioning debtor in each
individual case, the debtor being required to show that he is in fact unable
to pay his debts, and that he has not concealed his property. These changes in
the existing law are effected by the amendment in clauses 9 and 10(2) and
clause 12, which inserts a new section 16-A as to protection orders on the
lines of section 25 of the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act, 1909.A further
defect in the Act is the absence of provisions sufficiently defining the power
of Courts to decide questions of law and fact arising in insolvency
proceedings. In certain cases, e.g., those mentioned in sections 18(3), 36 and
37, the Court is empowered to pass orders, and section 47 defines the general
powers of the Court in regard to proceedings under the Act, but nowhere is a
general power conferred on the Court to deal with and decide important
questions of law and fact (e.g., a question of title to property) which may
arise in the insolvency proceedings. This question has recently been the
subject of conflicting decisions in the Allahabad and the Calcutta High
Courts. In Nilmoni Choudhury v. Durga Charan Choudhury (22 Cal.W.N. 704), the
Calcutta High Court dissenting from the Allahabad High Court held that the
Insolvency Court has no such power, and that a question of title to the
property should be tried in a separate suit. It is obviously desirable that
this conflict between the two High Courts should be terminated and having
regard to the prevalence of benami transactions in India and the importance of
arming Courts with adequate powers for the speedy realisation of assets in the
interests of creditors, the Government of India are of opinion that the Court
should be given full power to decide all questions raised in insolvency
proceedings. Clause 3 of the Bill accordingly enacts a provision on the lines
of section 7 of the Presidency Towns-Insolvency Act.Proceedings instituted
against fraudulent insolvents are frequently infructuous. This is largely due
to the lack of precision in the Act as to the procedure to be adopted by the
Court which desires to take action. The wording of sub-section (2) of section
43 is unduly vague, regard being had to the fact that it constitutes a
criminal offence, and experience has shown that it frequently creates
difficulties. It is proposed that the penal provisions of existing section 43
should be amended on the lines of section 103 of the Presidency-Towns
Insolvency Act, and that the procedure to be followed on a charge should be
defined on the lines of section 104 of that Act. It is proposed to embody
these provisions in the two separate sections 43-A and 43-B inserted by clause
19 of the Bill, which also inserts a new section 43-C containing provisions
similar to those of section 105 of the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act. It
seems desirable to make it clear that a dishonest insolvent who has been
guilty of an offence under the Act can be proceeded against even after he has
obtained his discharge, or after a composition submitted by him has been
accepted.A summary administration of petty insolvencies is, now largely
governed by rules made by the High Courts under section 51(2)(c) of the Act,
but it seems desirable that the Act itself should contain more detailed
provisions than at present, and that further simplification of procedure
should be effected. It is proposed therefore that, in addition to any further
modifications to be made by rules, section 48 should contain certain definite
provisions, and it is thought that, if these changes are made, it would be
well to confine summary administration to cases where the assets do not exceed
Rs. 200 instead of the existing limit of Rs. 500, and to reserve a discretion
to the Court to direct the ordinary procedure to be followed in cases where it
thinks such a course desirable.These amendments will, it is hoped, go far to
check the abuses rendered possible by the defects in the existing
law.Amendment Act 28 of 1978-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The
difficulties experienced by a litigant in India in executing even a simple
money decree have been commented upon by the Privy Council as well as by the
Law Commission and the Expert Committee on Legal Aid. The Law Commission in
its Third Report on the Limitation Act, 1908 has recommended that the most
effective way of instilling a healthy fear in the mind of the dishonest
judgment-debtor would be to enable the Court to adjudicate him an insolvent if
he does not pay the decretal amount after notice by the decree-holder, by
specifying a period within which it should be paid, on the lines of the
amendment made to the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 in Bombay. This
recommendation was reiterated by the Law Commission in its Twenty-sixth Report
on Insolvency Laws.2\. The Expert Committee on Legal Aid was also of the view
that the above recommendation of the Law Commission should be implemented
immediately without waiting for the enactment of a comprehensive law of
insolvency.3\. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Presidency-Towns
Insolvency Act, 1909, and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920, to add a new
act of insolvency namely, that a debtor has not complied with the insolvency
notice served on him by a creditor, who has obtained a decree or order against
him for the payment of money, within the period specified in the notice. If
the amount shown in the insolvency notice is not correct, it would be
invalidated if the debtor gives notice to the creditor disputing the amount.
The debtor can, however, apply to the Court to have the insolvency notice set
aside on the ground, among others, that he is entitled to have the decree
reopened under any law relating to relief of indebtedness or that the decree
is not executable under any such law.[25 th February , 1920]...An Act to

Section 3 (w.e.f. 1.9.1979).] A debtor commits an act of insolvency in each of
the following cases, namely:(a)if, in [India] [Substituted by A.O.1950, for
"the Provinces" .] or elsewhere, he makes a transfer of all or substantially
all his property to a third person for the benefit of his creditors
generally;(b)if, in [India] [Substituted by A.O.1950, for "the Provinces" .]
or elsewhere, he makes a transfer of his property or of any part thereof with
intent to defeat or delay his creditors;(c)if, in [India] [Substituted by
A.O.1950, for "the Provinces" .] or elsewhere, he makes any transfer of his
property, or of any part thereof, which would, under this or any other
enactment for the time being in force, be void as fraudulent preference if he
were adjudged an insolvent;(d)if, with intent to defeat or delay his
creditors,(i)he departs or remains out of [the territories to which this Act
extends] [Substituted by the Adaptation of Laws (No.3) Order, 1956, for "Part
A States and Part C States" .],(ii)he departs from his dwelling-house or usual
place of business or otherwise absents himself,(iii)he secludes himself so as
to deprive his creditors of the means of communicating with him;(e)if any of
his property has been sold in execution of the decree of any Court for the
payment of money;(f)if he petitions to be adjudged an insolvent under the
provisions of this Act;(g)if he gives notice to any of his creditors that he
has suspended, or that he is about to suspend, payment of his debts; or(h)if
he is imprisoned in execution of the decree of any Court for the payment of
money.(2)[ Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (1), a debtor
commits an act of insolvency if a creditor, who has obtained a decree or order
against him for the payment of money (being a decree or order which has become
final and the execution whereof has not been stayed), has served on him a
notice (hereafter in this section referred to as the insolvency notice) as
provided in sub-section (3) and the debtor does not comply with that notice
within the period specified therein:Provided that where a debtor makes an
application under sub-section (5) for setting aside an insolvency notice(a)in
a case where such application is allowed by the District Court, he shall not
be deemed to have committed an act of insolvency under this sub-section;
and(b)in a case where such application is rejected by the District Court, he
shall be deemed to have committed an act of insolvency under this sub-section
on the date of rejection of the application or the expiry of the period
specified in the insolvency notice for its compliance, whichever is
later:Provide further that no insolvency notice shall be served on a debtor
residing, whether permanently or temporarily, outside India, unless the
creditor obtains the leave of the District Court therefor.(3)An insolvency
notice under sub-section (2) shall(a)be in the prescribed form;(b)be served in
the prescribed manner;(c)specify the amount due under the decree or order and
require the debtor to pay the same or to furnish security for the payment of
such amount to the satisfaction of the creditor or his agent;(d)specify for
its compliance a period of not less than one month after its service on the
debtor or, if it is to be served on a debtor residing, whether permanently or
temporarily, outside India, such period (being not less than one month) as may
be specified by the order of the District Court granting leave for the service
of such notice;(e)state the consequences of non-compliance with the
notice.(4)No insolvency notice shall be deemed to be invalid by reason only
that the sum specified therein as the amount due under the decree or order
exceeds the amount actually due, unless the debtor, within the period
specified in the insolvency notice for its compliance, gives notice to the
creditor that the sum specified in the insolvency notice does not correctly
represent the amount due under the decree or order:Provided that if the debtor
does not give any such notice as aforesaid, he shall be deemed to have
complied with the insolvency notice if, within the period specified therein
for its compliance, he takes such steps as would have constituted a compliance
with the insolvency notice had the actual amount due been correctly specified
therein.(5)Any person served with an insolvency notice may, within the period
specified therein for its compliance, apply to the District Court to set aside
the insolvency notice on any of the following grounds, namely:(a)that he has a
counter-claim or set-off against the creditor which is equal to or is in
excess of the amount due under the decree or order and which he could not,
under any law for the time being in force, prefer in the suit or proceeding in
which the decree or order was passed;(b)that he is entitled to have the decree
or order set aside under any law providing for the relief of indebtedness and
that(i)he has made an application before the competent authority under such
law for the setting aside of the decree or order; or(ii)the time allowed for
the making of such application has not expired;(c)that the decree or order is
not executable under the provisions of any law referred to in clause (b)on the
date of the application.]Explanation. For the purposes of this section the act
of an agent may be the act of the principal.Petition

### 7. Petition and adjudication

of insolvency, an insolvency petition may be presented either by a creditor or
by the debtor, and the Court may on such petition make an order (hereinafter
called an order of adjudication) adjudging him an insolvent.Explanation. The
presentation of a petition by the debtor shall be deemed an act of insolvency
within the meaning of this section, and on such petition the Court may make an
order of adjudication.

### 8. Exemption of corporation, etc., from insolvency proceedings

.No insolvency petition shall be presented against any corporation or against
any association or company registered under any enactment for the time being

more creditors join in the petition, the aggregate amount of debts owing to
such creditors, amounts to five hundred rupees, and(b)the debt is a liquidated
sum payable either immediately or at some certain future time, and(c)the act
of insolvency on which the petition is grounded has occurred within three
months before the presentation of the petition:[Provided that where the said

the Court re-opens.] [Added by Act 3 of 1950, Section 6 (w.e.f.
18.2.1950).](2)If the petitioning creditor is a secured creditor, he shall in
his petition either state that he is willing to relinquish his security for
the benefit of the creditors in the event of the debtor being adjudged
insolvent, or give an estimate of the value of the security. In the latter

been annulled, owing to his failure to apply, or to prosecute an application
for his discharge, shall not be entitled to present an insolvency petition
without the leave of the Court by which the order of adjudication was
annulled. Such Court shall not grant leave unless it is satisfied either that

founded on facts substantially different from those contained in the petition
on which the order of adjudication was made.

### 11. Court to which petition shall be presented

under this Act in any local area in which the debtor ordinarily resides or
carries on business, or personally works for gain, or if he has been arrested
or imprisoned, where he is in custody:Provided that no objection as to the

force from liability to attachment and sale in execution of a decree;(f)a
statement whether the debtor has on any previous occasion filed a petition to
be adjudged an insolvent, and (where such a petition has been filed)(i)if such

shall thereupon have such of the powers conferrable on a receiver appointed
under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as the Court may direct.
If an interim receiver is not so appointed, the Court may make such
appointment at any subsequent time before adjudication, and the provisions of

until final orders are made upon the petition, and direct that, in default of
giving such security, he shall be detained in the civil prison;(2)order the
attachment by actual seizure of the whole or any part of the property in the
possession or under the control of the debtor, other than such particulars
(not being his books of account) as are exempted by the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), or by any other enactment for the time being in
force from liability to attachment and sale in execution of a decree;(3)order
a warrant to issue with or without bail for the arrest of the debtor, and
direct either that he be detained in the civil prison until the disposal of
the petition, or that he be released on such terms as to security as may be
reasonable and necessary:Provided that an order under clause (2) or clause (3)
shall not be made unless the Court is satisfied that the debtor, with intent
to defeat or delay his creditors or to avoid any process of the Court,(i)has
absconded or has departed from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the
Court, or is about to abscond or to depart from such limits, or is remaining
outside them, or(ii)has failed to disclose or has concealed, destroyed,

creditors in the course of the hearing, or any part of his property other than
such particulars as aforesaid.

### 22. Duties of debtors

.The debtor shall on the making of an order admitting the petition produce all
books of account, and shall at any time thereafter give such inventories of
his property, and such lists of his creditors and debtors and of the debts due
to and from them, respectively, submit to such examination in respect of his
property or his creditors, attend at such times before the Court or receiver,
execute such instruments, and generally do all such acts and things in
relation to his property as may be required by the Court or receiver, or as
may be prescribed.

### 23. Release of debtor

(1)At the time of making an order admitting the petition or at any subsequent
time before adjudication, the Court may, if the debtor is under arrest or
imprisonment in execution of the decree of any Court for the payment of money,
order his release on such terms as to security as may be reasonable and
necessary.(2)The Court may at any time order any person who has been released
under this section to be re-arrested and re-committed to the custody from
which he was released.(3)At the time of making any order under this section,
the Court shall record in writing its reasons therefor.

### 24. Procedure at hearing

(1)On the day fixed for the hearing of the petition, or on any subsequent day
to which the hearing may be adjourned, the Court shall require proof of the
following matters, namely:(a)that the creditor or the debtor, as the case may
be, is entitled to present the petition:Provided that, where the debtor is the
petitioner, he shall, for the purpose of proving his inability to pay his
debts, be required to furnish only such proof as to satisfy the Court that
there are prima facie grounds for believing the same and the Court, if and
when so satisfied, shall not be bound to hear any further evidence
thereon;(b)that the debtor, if he does not appear on a petition presented by a
creditor, has been served with notice of the order admitting the petition;
and(c)that the debtor has committed the act of insolvency alleged against
him.(2)The Court shall also examine the debtor, if he is present, as to his
conduct, dealings and property in the presence of such creditors as appear at
the hearing, and the creditors shall have the right to question the debtor
thereon.(3)The Court shall, if sufficient cause is shown, grant time to the
debtor or to any creditor to produce any evidence which appears to it to be
necessary for the proper disposal of the petition.(4)A memorandum of the
substance of the examination of the debtor and of any other oral evidence
given shall be made by the Judge, and shall form part of the record of the
case.

### 25. Dismissal of petition

(1)In the case of a petition presented by a creditor, where the Court is not
satisfied with the proof of his right to present the petition or of the
service on the debtor of notice of the order admitting the petition, or of the
alleged act of insolvency, or is satisfied by the debtor that he is able to
pay his debts, or that for any other sufficient cause no order ought to be
made, the Court shall dismiss the petition.(2)In the case of a petition
presented by a debtor, the Court shall dismiss the petition if it is not
satisfied of his right to present the petition.

### 26. Award of compensation

(1)Where a petition presented by a creditor is dismissed under sub-section (1)

adjudge the debtor insolvent and annul the composition or scheme but without
prejudice to the validity of any transfer or payment duly made or of anything
duly done under or in pursuance of the composition or scheme. When a debtor is

fact that the assets are not of a value equal to eight annas in the rupee on
the amount of his unsecured liabilities has arisen from circumstances for
which he cannot justly be held responsible;(b)that the insolvent has omitted
to keep such books of account as are usual and proper in the business carried
on by him and as sufficiently disclose his business transactions and financial
position within the three years immediately preceding his insolvency;(c)that
the insolvent has continued to trade after knowing himself to be

would be able to pay it;(e)that the insolvent has failed to account
satisfactorily for any loss of assets or for any deficiency of assets to meet
his liabilities;(f)that the insolvent has brought on, or contributed to, his
insolvency by rash and hazardous speculations, or by unjustifiable

affairs;(g)that the insolvent has, within three months preceding the date of
the presentation of the petition, when unable to pay his debts as they became
due, given an undue preference to any of his creditors;(h)that the insolvent

order as it may think fit, and if the adjudication is so annulled, the
provisions of section 37 shall apply.] [Substituted by Act 3 of 1950, Section
7, for "the order of adjudication shall be annulled, and the provisions of
section 37 shall apply accordingly" .](2)Where a debtor has been released from
custody under the provisions of this Act and the order of adjudication is

custody such debtor is so re-committed shall receive such debtor into his
custody according to such re-commitment, and thereupon all processes which
were in force against the person of such debtor at the time of such release as
aforesaid shall be deemed to be still in force against him as if no order of
adjudication had been made.

to the time when the debt would have become payable, according to the terms on
which it was contracted.

### 46. Mutual dealings and set-off

.Where there have been mutual dealings between an insolvent and a creditor
proving or claiming to prove a debt under this Act, an account shall be taken
of what is due from the one party to the other in respect of such mutual

due from the other party, and the balance of the account, and no more, shall
be claimed or paid on either side respectively.

balance due to him, after deducting the net amount realised.(2)Where a secured
creditor relinquishes his security for the general benefit of the creditors,

realise or relinquish his security, he shall, before being entitled to have
his debt entered in the schedule, state in his proof the particulars of his
security, and the value at which he assesses it, and shall be entitled to
receive a dividend only in respect of the balance due to him after deducting
the value so assessed.(4)Where a security is so valued, the Court may at any
time before realisation redeem it on payment to the creditor of the assessed
value.(5)Where a creditor, after having valued his security, subsequently
realises it, the net amount realised shall be substituted for the amount of
any valuation previously made by the creditor, and shall be treated in all
respects as an amended valuation made by the creditor.(6)Where a secured
creditor does not comply with the provisions of this section, he shall be
excluded from all share in any dividend.

### 48. Interest

(1)On any debt or sum certain whereon interest is not reserved or agreed for,

exceeding six per centum per annum(a)if the debt or sum is payable by virtue
of a written instrument at a certain time, from the time when such debt or sum
was payable to the date of such adjudication; or,(b)if the debt or sum is
payable otherwise, from the time when a demand in writing has been made giving
the debtor notice that interest will be claimed from the date of the demand
until the time of payment to the date of such adjudication.(2)Where a debt
which has been proved under this Act includes interest or any pecuniary
consideration in lieu of interest, the interest or consideration shall, for
the purposes of dividend, be calculated at a rate not exceeding six per centum
per annum, without prejudice to the right of a creditor to receive out of the
debtors estate any higher rate of interest to which he may be entitled after
all the debts proved have been paid in full.

### 49. Mode of proof

(1)A debt may be proved under this Act by delivering, or sending by post in a
registered letter, to the Court an affidavit verifying the debt.(2)The

same can be substantiated. The Court may at any time call for the production
of the vouchers.

(1)Where the receiver thinks that a debt has been improperly entered in the
schedule, the Court may, on the application of the receiver and after notice
to the creditor, and such inquiry (if any) as the Court thinks necessary,
expunge such entry or reduce the amount of the debt.(2)The Court may also,
after like inquiry, expunge an entry or reduce the amount of a debt upon the
application of a creditor where no receiver has been appointed, or where the
receiver declines to interfere in the matter or, in the case of a composition
or scheme, upon the application of the debtor.Effect of insolvency on

shall, if such person is adjudged insolvent on a petition presented within
three months after the date thereof, be deemed fraudulent and void as against
the receiver, and shall be annulled by the Court.(2)This section shall not
affect the rights of any person who in good faith and for valuable
consideration has acquired a title through or under a creditor of the

dividend or dividends shall be entitled to be paid, out of any money for the
time being in the hands of the receiver, any dividend or dividends which he
may have failed to receive before that money is applied to the payment of any
future dividend or dividends; but he shall not be entitled to disturb the
distribution of any dividend declared before his debt was proved by reason
that he has not participated therein.

### 64. Final dividend

.When the receiver has realised all the property of the insolvent or so much
thereof as can, in the opinion of the Court, be realised without needlessly
protracting the receivership, he shall declare a final dividend; but before so
doing, he shall give notice in manner prescribed to the persons whose claims
to be creditors have been notified but not proved, that if they do not prove
their claims within the time limited by the notice, he will proceed to make a
final dividend without regard to their claims. After the expiration of the
time so limited, or if the Court, on application by any such claimant, grants
him further time for establishing his claim, then on the expiration of such
further time, the property of the insolvent shall be divided among the
creditors entered in the schedule without regard to the claims of any other
persons.

### 65. No suit for dividend

refuses to pay any dividend, the Court may, on the application of any creditor
who is entered in the schedule, order him to pay it, and also to pay out of
his own money interest thereon for the time that it is withheld, and the costs
of the application.

terms as the Court may direct.(2)The Court may, from time to time, make such
allowance as it may think just to the insolvent out of his property for the
support of himself and his family, or in consideration of his services if he
is engaged in winding up his estate; but any such allowance may, at any time,
be varied or determined by the Court.

### 67. Right of insolvent to surplus

.The insolvent shall be entitled to any surplus remaining after payment in
full of his creditors with interest as provided by this Act, and of the
expenses of the proceedings taken thereunder.[67-A. Committee of inspection

general powers-of-attorney from such creditors.(3)The committee of inspection

be prescribed.]Appeal to Court against receiver
