**_Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (First
Amendment) Bill, 1951 which was enacted as the Constitution (First Amendment)
Act, 1951_****STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS** During the last fifteen
months of the working of the Constitution, certain difficulties have been
brought to light by judicial decisions and pronouncements specially in regard
to the chapter on fundamental rights. The citizen's right to freedom of speech
and expression guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) has been held by some courts to
be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates
murder and other crimes of violence. In other countries with written
constitutions, freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring
the State from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom. The citizen's
right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or
business conferred by article 19(1)(g) is subject to reasonable restrictions
which the laws of the State may impose "in the interests of general public".
While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of
nationalisation which the State may undertake, it is desirable to place the
matter beyond doubt by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Another
article in regard to which unanticipated difficulties have arisen is article
31. The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legislatures
in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6)
of article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result
of which the implementation of theseimportant measures, affecting large
numbers of people, has been held up.The main objects of this Bill are,
accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert
provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition
laws in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. the
opportunity has been taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles
in order to remove difficulties that may arise.It is laid down in article 46
as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote with
special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of
the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special
provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social
advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the
groundof being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be
suitably amplified. Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the
convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliament have been found
necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill. So also a few minor
amendments in respect of articles 341, 342, 372 and 376.An Act to amend the
Constitution of IndiaBe it enacted by Parliament as follows:-

### 1. Short title.-

or(ii)the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by

Constitution as amended by sub-section (1) of this section shall be deemed to
be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground only that, being a law

[The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, made several changes to the
Fundamental Rights Part of the Indian constitution. It was moved by the then
Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, on 10 May 1951 in Lok Sabha and
came into effect on 18 June 1951. The Amendment established a precedent for
amending the Constitution to override judicial decisions that prevented the
government from carrying out its obligations to specific policies and
programs. It amended the Fundamental Rights clauses of the Indian Constitution
in several ways. It gave ways to limit freedom of speech and expression in
certain issues, supported measures to abolish zamindari, and made it clear
that the right to equality does not preclude passing laws that give special
consideration to society’s most vulnerable groups. The Statement of Reasons
(SOR) relating to the First Amendment said: “Challenges to agrarian laws or
laws relating to land reform were pending in courts and were holding up large
schemes of land legislation through dilatory and wasteful litigation.”
