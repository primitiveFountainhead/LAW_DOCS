Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961(Tamil Nadu Act
58 of 1961)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu 58 of 1961). - Having
regard to the recommendations of the Planning Commission in the Second Five-
Year Plan for reducing the glaring inequalities in the ownership of
agricultural land, the Government have decided to undertake legislation for
prescribing the maximum extent of agricultural land that a person may hold.
The ceiling will, except as otherwise provided in the Bill, apply to all
agricultural lands held by a person either as owner or as an usufructuary
mortgagee or as a tenant or as an intermediary or in one or more of those
capacities. The provisions of the Bill will apply to the whole of the State of
Madras. The Bill contains provisions for controlling future acquisition of
agricultural land.2\. The provisions of the Bill are explained in Notes on
Clauses.Published in Part IV-A of the Fort St. George Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 16th April 1960.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1967
(Tamil Nadu Act 22 of l967). - Section 59 of the Madras Land Reforms (Fixation
of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Madras Act 58 of 1961) originally provided that
the provisions of Chapter VIII of that Act shall remain in force for a period
of three years from the date of publication of the Act, namely, the 2nd May
1962. The life of this chapter was extended by three years by the Madras Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1965 (Madras Act 10 of
1965). The chapter will now expire on the 2nd May 1968.2\. Chapter VIII of the
Act deals with the cultivating tenant's ceiling area. The proposal to enact a
single Comprehensive Tenancy Act embodying all the tenancy enactments in force
in the State including Chapter VIII of the Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, with suitable modifications with reference to the
recommendations made by the Planning Commission, the Government of India etc.,
from time to time is separately under the Consideration of the Government.
This Comprehensive Tenancy Bill is hot likely to come up before the expiry of
the life of Chapter VIII of the Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on
Land) Act, 1961. It has, therefore, been decided to amend section 59 of the
Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Madras Act 58 of
1961) so as to extend the life of Chapter VIII for a further period of two
years form the 2nd May 1968.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
object.Published in Part IV-Section 3,of the Fort St. George Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 25th November 1967.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1970
(Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 1970). - Section 59 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961) originally
provided that the provisions of Chapter VIII of that Act, relating to
cultivating tenant's ceiling area, shall remain in force for a period of three
years from the date of publication of the Act, namely, the 2nd May 1962. By
the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1965
(Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1965), the life of this chapter was extended by three
years from the 2nd May 1965. The life of this chapter was further extended by
another two years by the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Amendment Act, 1967 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1967). The chapter will now expire
on the 2nd May 1970.2\. A proposal to enact a single comprehensive Tenancy Act
is separately under consideration of the Government. This proposal is not
likely to materialise before the expiry of the life of the said Chapter VIII.
The Government have therefore decided to amend section 59 of the Tamil Nadu
Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of
1961) so as to extend the life of Chapter VIII for a further period of two
years from the 2nd May 1970.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
object.Published in Part IV-Section 3 page 62 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 4th April 1970.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Reduction of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1970
(Tamil Nadu Act 17 of 1970). - According to section 5 of the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, the ceiling area in the case
of every person and in the case of every family consisting of not more than
five members, is 30 standard acres. Even after the implementation of the said
Act, there is disparity in the ownership of agricultural land leading to the
concentration of such land in the hands of certain persons to the common
detriment. As a further step towards 'agrarian reform it is considered
necessary to reduce such disparity. With a view to achieve this object it is
considered necessary to reduce the ceiling area from 30 standard acres to 15
standard acres.The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.Published in Part
IV-Section 3 page 54 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated
the 31st March 1970.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Reduction of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1970 (Tamil Nadu Act 17 of 1970). -
According to section 5 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on
Land) Act, 1961, the ceiling area in the case of every person and in the case
of every family consisting of not more than five members, is 30 standard
acres. Even after the implementation of the said Act, there is disparity in
the ownership of agricultural land leading to the concentration of such land
in the hands of certain persons to the common detriment. As a further step
towards agrarian reform, it is considered necessary to reduce such disparity.
With a view to achieve this object, it is considered necessary to reduce the
ceiling area from 30 standard acres to 15 standard acres.The Bill seeks to
achieve the above object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 31st March 1970.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Amendment Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 41 of 1971). - Under the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, the ceiling area in the case
of every person and in the case of every family consisting of not more than
five members, was 30 standard acres. Even after the implementation of the said
Act, there has been disparity in the ownership of agricultural land leading to
the concentration of such land in the hands of certain persons to the common
detriment. Therefore, by the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Reduction of Ceiling on
Land) Act, 1970, the Government reduced the ceiling area from 30 standard
acres to 15 standard acres.2\. As a further step towards agrarian reform and
for the effective implementation of the Act, the Government decided to review
the exemptions contained in the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling
on Land) Act, 1961. Accordingly, a Committee consisting of legislators of both
the Houses was constituted to go into the question and recommend on the
continuance or otherwise of the various exemptions contained in the Land
Ceiling Act of 1961. The Committee has also recommended that the exemptions
contained in the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 in respect of lands used exclusively for grazing and assessed to land
revenue at Rs. 1.25 and below per acre and lands used for the cultivation of
sugar-cane and in respect of which the Sugar Factory Board has granted
permission under section 40 or 43 of the Act, may be deleted. The Government
have accepted the recommendation of the Committee and have decided to withdraw
the exemption in regard to the two items mentioned above.3\. Provision has
been made in the Bill for acquisition of surplus land held by Sugar Factories
and for cultivation of such land by a corporation (including a company) owned
or controlled by the State. The lands held on a tenancy basis which is within
the ceiling area of the landowner shall be deemed to be held on a tenancy
basis by the corporation to ensure continued supply of sugar-cane to the
factory. Such land will be held by the factory only till the expiry of the
period of contract of tenancy. An extent of land not exceeding 100 standard
acres held by the sugar factory solely for research and seed farm purposes has
also been exempted from the operation of the Act.4\. Provision has been made
to the effect that the surplus land acquired from the sugar factory may be
redistributed in accordance with the rules made under section 94. Incidental
provision for the abolition of the Sugar Factory Board and the Sugar Factory
Tribunal has also been made.5\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 7th July 1971.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1972 (Tamil
Nadu Act 20 of 1972). - Section 59 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), originally provided
that the provisions of Chapter VIII of that Act relating to cultivating
tenant's ceiling area shall remain in force for a period of three years from
the date of the publication of the Act, namely, the 2nd May 1962. The life of
this Chapter was extended, from time to time, by legislation. By the Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1970 (Tamil
Nadu Act 9 of 1970), the life of this Chapter was last extended up to the 1st
May 1972. The life of this Chapter will expire on the 2nd May 1972. The
Government have decided to retain this Chapter permanently by omitting section
59 of the Act.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.Published in Part
IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 28th
March 1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 20 of
1972). - Under sub-section (5) of section 5 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), the
maximum extent of land which a family consisting of more than five members can
hold is 60 standard acres. It has been decided to reduce this maximum extent
from 60 standard acres to 40 standard acres.2\. The Committee of Legislators
of both Houses constituted to review the exemptions contained in the Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, has recommended the
deletion of the exemption in respect of hill areas contained in section 73(v)
of the Act. The Government have accepted this recommendation and the Bill
seeks to give effect to the deletion of the exemption in respect of hill
areas.3\. Sub-clause (2) of clause (40) of section 3 of Tamil Nadu Act 58 of
1961 prescribes the formula for conversion of ordinary acres into standard
acres in respect of lands in the Kanyakumari district. The wet lands irrigated
by rain-fed tanks in Kanyakumari district are not covered by this formula. It
has, therefore, been decided to amend sub-clause (2) of clause (40) of section
3 so as to treat the wet-lands irrigated by rain-fed tanks in the Kanyakumari
district to be on a par with the dry lands irrigated by rain-fed tanks for the
purpose of calculation of standard acre.4\. Under section 60 of the said Act,
the cultivating tenant's ceiling area means 5 standard acres. According to
sub-rule (2-A) of rule 51 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling
on Land) Rules, 1962, where the authorized officer finds that the land held by
a cultivating tenant excess of the cultivating tenant's ceiling area is more
than 1/2 an acre in the case of wet lands and one acre in the case of dry
lands, the authorized officer may for reasons to be recorded in writing leave
such excess land in the possession of the cultivating tenant. On the
recommendation of the Committee on Subordinate Legislation, it has been
decided to incorporate the above provision in the Act by amending section 62
suitably, as it was felt that the power given under the rules to the
authorized officer to allow any land in excess of the cultivating tenant's
ceiling area to remain with the tenant would not be proper.5\. According to
clause (iv) of section 73 of the said Act, nothing contained in the Act will
apply to any land held by any industrial or commercial undertaking other than
a co-operative society which in the opinion of the Government bona fide
carries on industrial or commercial operation and which is approved by the
Government. Under this section, if the approval is given by the Government,
then, the industrial or commercial undertaking can hold any extent of land.
There is no power under this section to restrict the extent of land in respect
of which the undertaking should enjoy the exemptions. It has, therefore, now
been decided to provide in new section 37-A that an industrial or commercial
undertaking should apply to the Government for permission to hold or acquire
land in excess of the ceiling area. The exemption will be applicable only in
respect of those lands specified in the order granting permission, provided
that the conditions specified in the order granting exemption are complied
with.6\. Section 111 of the said Act empowers the Government to issue orders
to remove any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to any of the
provisions of the Act. The Supreme Court in Messrs. Jalan Trading Company v.
Mill Mazdoor Sabha [1967] 1 SCJ 189 has observed that the power to remove
difficulty by altering the provisions of the Act would in substance amount to
exercise of legislative authority and that such power cannot be delegated to
an executive authority. This opportunity has, therefore, been availed of to
omit section 111.7\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. This Bill
attempts to make the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Act, 1961 a comprehensive one by incorporating provisions which are in line
with the change of time and which are really beneficial to the tillers of the
soil. It may be remembered that before the Act came into force, there were
large scale transactions resulting in benami alienations of lands in order to
defeat the very purpose of this Act and in fact the surplus land declared was
negligible in contrast to the vast tract of land in our State. Several
agitations were carried on and many people laid their lives to rectify such
loop-holes. Further, even the ceiling fixed in the Act, was not in tune with
the public demand. Taking the demands from the public and of the progressive
movements, amendments have been proposed in this Bill. If the proposed
amendments are carried out, it means:-Absentee landlordism is abolished for
ever; tenant is given his option to purchase the land comprised in his holding
at a very reasonable price; tenant is granted fixity of tenure and the
safeguard not to be evicted under no circumstances; small landholders is
protected from his land; ceiling limit to which a person or family is entitled
to hold is reduced; exemption granted under the present Act is totally removed
except in the case of the Government lands; and ways and means are provided
for disposal of the land to the landless poor.Published in Part IV-Section 1
of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 30th March
1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Third Amendment Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 37 of 1972). -
Under section 73F(ii) of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on
Land) Act, 1961, the ceiling limit will not apply to any land held by-(a) any
charitable or educational institution of a public nature;(b) any trust;(c) any
University constituted by any law.According to section 3(49) "Trust" means
Trust for a public purpose of a religious or charitable or of an educational
nature and any temple, math, mosque, church or other place, by includes
whatever name known which is dedicated to, or for the benefit of, or used as
of right by any community or section thereof as a place of public religious
worship. Section 2 of the Act says that nothing contained in the Act shall
apply to lands held by religious Trusts of a public nature.2\. In the budget
speech presented on 1st March 1972, the Chief Minister announced that all
exemptions in favour of trusts created after 26th January 1950 the date on
which our Constitution came into force would be withdrawn except for a limited
extent to be allowed for trusts for educational purposes and medical
facilities.3\. The Government have examined the matter further. They have
decided that lands held by religious institutions as patta lands should
continue to be exempted from the Land Ceiling Act. They have also decided that
"Trust" as such need not continue to be exempted whether such Trust is created
before or after the 26th January 1950. However, the Government have examined
the requirements of various Colleges, High Schools and Hospitals in the State.
After taking all relevant aspects into consideration, they have decided that
in the case of colleges which are mentioned in Part I of Schedule I, the
ceiling area will be 60 standard acres. In the case of High Schools which are
mentioned in Part II of Schedule I, the ceiling area will be 20 standard
acres. In the case of hospitals mentioned in Part III of Schedule I, the
ceiling area will be the extent of the land held by such hospital as on the
1st March 1972. These hospitals cannot acquire in future any land in excess of
the land already held by them on 1st March 1972.4\. The ceiling area in
pursuance of the Bill, when enacted into law, will be fixed with reference to
the 1st day of March 1972, the date on which the Chief Minister made the
announcement in the budget speech.5\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 3rd April 1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Fourth Amendment Act,
1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 39 of 1972). - The Committee of legislators of both the
Houses constituted to review the exemptions contained in the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act 1961 has recommended the deletion of
the exemption in respect of lands used for dairy farming or live-stock
breeding contained in section 73(x) of the Act. The Government have accepted
the recommendation of the Committee.2\. Consequent on the deletion of the
exemption in respect of lands used for dairy farming or live-stock breeding,
the functions of the Land Board will be confined only to grant of permission
under section 31 of the Act to hold lands interspersed among or contiguous to
any plantation. The Government have, therefore, decided to change the
constitution of the Land Board.3\. Under sub-section (5) of section 5 of the
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu
Act 58 of 1961), as amended by the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Act (Tamil Nadu Act 20 of 1972), the maximum
extent of land which a family consisting more than five members can hold is 40
standard acres. It has been decided to reduce this maximum extent from 40
standard acres to 30 standard acres, viz., twice the extent allowed for a
family consisting of five members or less.4\. The High Court has held that a
person who has a right to enjoy the land during his life time without a power
to alienate is not a limited owner as defined in clause (28) of section 3 of
the Act. It has, therefore, been decided to amend this section to the effect
that a person who has right to enjoy the land during his life time shall be
deemed to be a limited owner notwithstanding that he has no power to alienate
the land. This amendment take effect from 6th April 1960 which is the date of
commencement of Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961.5\. At present there is no power
vested in any authority to reopen a case finalised under the Act, if for any
reason the extent of any land held by a person has been omitted to be included
in the total extent of the land held by such person for the purposes of the
Act. It has, therefore, been decided to insert a new provision giving power to
the Land Commissioner to direct authorised officer to reopen the cases in
cases of omission of land to be included in the total extent held by a
person.6\. Section 8(1) allows a time limit of 90 days for filing returns by a
person holding land in excess of the ceiling limit. Section 10(5) allows 60
days time to file objections by a person interested in the land in respect of
which draft statement has been published. Section 50(2) allows 60 plus 30 days
time for preferring claim for compensation for the land acquired. Section
50(3)(a)(ii) allows 60 plus 30 days time for preferring objections to the
draft compensation assessment roll. Section 51(1) allows 90 days time for
preferring claims by mortgagees or charge holders of the land acquired.
Section 78(1) allows 60 days time to land holders to file appeal to the Land
Tribunal against the decision of the authorised officer. The time now allowed
for filing returns, filing of objections, etc., under the various provisions
referred to above is considered too long as this leads to prolongation of the
proceedings of the Act in each case resulting in delay in the implementation
of the Act. It has, therefore, been decided to reduce the time allowed under
the various sections referred to above except section 51(1) to 30 days and to
reduce the time allowed under section 51(1) to 60 days.7\. It has been decided
to omit the existing section 81 of the Act relating to the revisional
jurisdiction of the Land Tribunal and to entrust the revisional jurisdiction
to the Land Commissioner in respect of the matters specified in that
section.8\. At the conference of Chief Ministers held on 23rd July 1972 at New
Delhi, it was decided that the compensation for surplus land acquired should
be on a slab basis with the quantum decreasing with increase in the size of
the holding. The existing provision in Schedule HI to Act 58 of 1961 provides
for calculation of the compensation on the basis of the multiples of net
annual income. The net annual income is the amount of fair rent less the land
revenue. It has been decided to revise the slabs prescribed in paragraph 6 of
Part I of Schedule III for purposes of calculation of the compensation so that
the quantum of compensation will decrease with the increase in the size of the
holding. It has also been decided that for the purpose of determining the
normal gross produce of the lands acquired, the value of gross produce as
furnished in the return filed by the landowner under the Tamil Nadu
Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1955 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1955), shall be taken
account. It has also been decided that the compensation payable for any
building, machinery, plant, etc., acquired under the Act shall be the written
down value determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act,
1961 (Central Act 43 of 1961), of such building, machinery, plant, etc., on
the date of the publication of the notification under section 18(1). The
revised formula for determination of the compensation will take effect on and
from the date of the publication of the amending Act, that is, to lands which
vest in the Government after the date of publication of the amending Act.9\.
The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects.Published in Part IV-
Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 12th
August 1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Sixth Amendment Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 7 of
1974). - Under existing section 18(3) of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation
of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), the surplus land
vests in the Government with effect from the date of the publication of the
notification under sub-section (1) of section 18. This notification is
published after all the procedural formalities are complied with. Though
section 7 prohibits that no person should hold land in excess of the ceiling
area after the date of the commencement of the Act, by reason of sub-section
(3) of section 18, the owner continues to be in possession of the surplus land
after the date of the commencement of the Act and before the date of the
vesting of the surplus land in the Government. In some cases, this period
ranges to some years, during which the owner continues to enjoy the surplus
land. It has been suggested that having regard to the spirit of the land
reform measure, the surplus land as finally declared by the competent
authority should vest in the Government even from the date of the commencement
of the Act which is the crucial date for the purposes of fixing the ceiling
area and that the owner of the land or any person deriving benefit therefrom
should be made liable to pay to the Government an amount as compensation for
the use and occupation of the land for the period for which he was in
possession of the surplus land. Clause 3(2) seeks to achieve this object.2\.
Under section 22, any transfer made after the date of the commencement of the
Act, but before the notified date is declared as void by the authorised
officer if such transfer defeats the provisions of the Act. Under section
10(4), owner has the option to choose the land which is to be included within
his ceiling area. In many cases the owners of land, who have transferred the
land during the period mentioned in section 22, have indicated in their return
their desire that the land so transferred and which transfer has been declared
as void, should be taken over by the Government as surplus land. This results
in a double advantage to the land owner, namely, that in addition to the
consideration received by him from the purchaser, he is entitled to
compensation from the Government for such surplus land. The Government have
decided that such unintended benefit should not enure to the owner of land and
that lands declared as void under section 22 should be compulsorily included
within the ceiling area of the transferor by the authorised officer, without
affecting the rights of the transferee. The result will be that the purchaser
will not be disturbed from the possession of his land and the transferor will
not be entitled to any compensation. Clause 3(1) of the Bill seeks to achieve
this object.3\. Under section 21-A as amended by clause 3(8) of the Tamil Nadu
Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Third Amendment Bill, 1972,
partition is permissible between 15-2-1970 and 2-10-1970. The intention is
that the partitions effected to defeat the purpose of the Act made after
2-10-1970 and during the period referred to in section 22 should not be
permitted. Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to achieve this object.4\. A new section
88-A is proposed to be inserted providing for punishment for those persons who
have-specified in their return that the lands, the transfer of which was
declared void under section 22, should be taken over by the Government as
surplus land of the transferor. Clause 5 seeks to achieve this
object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 4th December 1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Fifth Amendment Act,
1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1974). - Under section 73(vii) of the Tamil Nadu
Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, lands converted on or
before the 1st day of July 1959 into orchards or topes or areca nut gardens
are exempt from the Ceiling Act so long as they continue to be orchards, topes
or areca nut gardens. The High Court has held in State of Madras v. Thadikkara
Vanniar (C. R. P. No. 859/67) that plantain is a fruit bearing tree falling
under the definition of the term "tope" in section 3(47) of the Act and
consequently lands grown with plantain crops on the first day of July 1959 may
become eligible for exemption from the ceiling law. The Government have,
therefore, decided to exclude plantain from the definitions of the terms
"orchards and tope" so as to bring the lands grown with plantain crops within
the ceiling law.2\. Under section 73(iii) of the Act, any land owned by such
cO-operative societies (other than societies registered or deemed to have been
registered under the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1932 or under the
Travancore-Cochin Co-operative Societies Act, 1951), as are approved by the
Government are exempt from the provisions of the ceiling law. The Government
have decided that the above provision should be amended so as to confine the
exemption only to any land assigned by the Government to, and held by, any
Land Colonisation Co-operative Society.3\. Under section 73(vi) of Tamil Nadu
Act 58 of 1961, all plantations in existence on the date of the commencement
of the Act are exempt from the ceiling law. Similarly, under section 73
(viii), any land used exclusively for growing fuel trees on the date of the
commencement of the Act is exempt from the ceiling law. The date of the
commencement of the Act with reference to the principal Act was 6th April 1960
and consequently plantations and fuel trees that were in existence on 6th
April 1960 in any area other than the hill area were exempt from the ceiling
law. Further, under section 31 of the Act, any plantation could be permitted
to hold any land interspersed among or contiguous to such plantation, up to 20
per cent of the extent of such plantation winch existed on 6th April 1960. By
the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Reduction of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1970 (Tamil
Nadu Act 17 of 1970), the definition of the date of the commencement of the
Act in clause (11) of section 3 of the principal Act was modified as 15th day
of February 1970. Consequently, the exemption in respect of plantations
specified in section 73(vi) and fuel trees specified in section 73(viii)
should be construed to apply to the extent of plantations and fuel trees as
were in existence on 15th February 1970. The exemption in respect of lands in
hill areas has been withdrawn with effect from 1st March 1972. The Government
have now decided that the exemption in respect of plantations and fuel trees
should be restricted to the extent of plantations and fuel trees that were in
existence on 6th April 1960 and that the permission to be granted under
section 31 of the Act to any plantation to hold additional extent of land
should be restricted to 20 per cent of the extent of such plantation as was in
existence on 6th April 1960.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette

(Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 1974). - Under section 82 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, the Land Commissioner may call for
and examine the record of any Authorised Officer in respect of any proceeding
under the Act not being a proceeding in respect of which a suit or an appeal
to the Land Tribunal is provided, to satisfy himself as to the regularity of
such proceedings or the correctness, legality or propriety of any decision or
order passed thereon, and if in any case it appears to the Land Commissioner
that any such proceeding, decision or order should be modified, reversed or
remitted for reconsideration, he can pass orders accordingly.2\. The Act does
not prescribe any time-limit within which the parties can invoke the
revisionary powers of the Land Commissioner under section 82. It is necessary
to prescribe a time-limit for preferring application for revision to the Land
Commissioner under the said section in order to give finality to the
proceedings under the Act. It is accordingly proposed to take powers for
prescribing by rules the time-limit for preferring application for revision
under the said section.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 26th November 1973.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1974
(Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1974). - The surplus land specified in the final
statement under section 12 or 14 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 vests in the Government absolutely on the
publication of the notification by the Government under sub-section (1) of
section 18. At present, there is no provision in the Act empowering the
Government either to modify or cancel the notification issued under section
18(1). Cases have been brought to the notice of the Government where as a
result of decisions in appeal or revision, the notification issued under
section 18(1) requires cancellation or modification to give effect to such
decision. There have also been cases where the authorised officer has
corrected under section 15 bona fide mistakes and clerical errors in the final
statement under sections 12 and 14 and consequently the notifications issued
under section 18(1) have also to be corrected. Cases may also arise where in
pursuance of a direction under section 18-A by the Land Commissioner, the
notification issued under section 18(1) may require modification. It is,
therefore, proposed to take necessary power for the Government to modify or
cancel the notification published by them under sub-section (1) of section 18
to give effect to decisions in appeal or revision or other proceeding, or in
pursuance of a direction under section 18-A. It is also proposed to empower
the Government to make consequential changes in section 18(1) notification in
pursuance of the corrections made by the authorised officer under section 15.
Necessary supplemental and incidental provisions have also been proposed.2\.
The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of
the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 25th January
1974.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 25 of 1978). - According
to section 18(3) of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), as it stood prior to the amendment made
by the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Sixth Amendment
Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 7 of 1974), surplus land notified under section
18(1) of that Act shall be deemed to have been acquired and vested in the
Government with effect from the date of publication of such notification under
the said section 18(1).The rates of compensation specified in Schedule III in
Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961 have been revised by the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Fourth Amendment Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 39 of
1972) fixing a lower rate of compensation and the revised rates came into
force on the 21st December, 1972, the date on which the said Tamil Nadu Act 39
of 1972 was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette.Subsequently, by
the said Tamil Nadu Act 7 of 1974, section 18(3) was amended, with
retrospective effect from the 1st March 1972 to the effect that lands notified
under section 18(1) of the Act as surplus lands shall be deemed to have been
acquired, and vested in the Government from the date of commencement of the
Act. The deeming provision made by Tamil Nadu Act 7 of 1974 providing for
vesting of surplus lands with effect from the date of commencement of the Act
has given rise to certain practical difficulties in the implementation of the
Act. In interpreting section 18(3), as amended by Tamil Nadu Act 7 of 1974,
Madras High Court had held that under section 18(3), as amended,
notwithstanding the fact that notification under section 18(1) was published
on a later date, such lands declared to have been surplus shall be deemed to
have vested in the Government with effect from the date of commencement of the
Act, i.e., the 15th January 1972 and the revised formula prescribed in
Schedule III of the principal Act as amended by Tamil Nadu Act 39 of 1972
cannot be made applicable to such cases and the authorised officer has to
adopt the rates in the unamended Schedule III. It is, therefore, proposed to
amend the Act so that this surplus lands notified under section 18(1) may vest
with the Government only from the date of publication of the notification
under the said section 18(1) as it stood prior to the amendment made by Tamil
Nadu Act 7 of 1974 and compensation can be determined with reference to the
date of such vesting of the surplus lands in the Government. Clause 4(1) of
the Bill seeks to provide for this purpose.The Government are also of the view
that the existing provision under section 18(3-A) should be amended to the
effect that the liability of the erstwhile land-owner for the payment of
compensation must accrue only if the land-owner continues to occupy or derive
benefit from the property, even after the date of vesting of the property in
the Government. It is accordingly proposed to omit section 18(3-A) and insert
a new provision as section 18-F for this purpose. Clause 4(2) of the Bill
provides for this purpose.Clause 4(3) seeks to amend section 50(1) of the
principal Act, to the effect that compensation shall be paid at the rates
specified in Schedule III as in force on the dale of acquisition of surplus
land.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.Published in Part IV-
Section 1 page 242 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated
the 28th March 1978.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Act, 1979 (Tamil Nadu Act 11 of
1979). - Under the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), the compensation for the surplus lands of a
family is determined for the family as a whole. The High Court has held in a
case to the effect that for the purpose of fixing the compensation, every
person whose right, title or interest on the land has been acquired by
Government should be treated separately and the compensation payable to each
member should be worked out and paid separately. If the compensation is so
worked out and paid separately, it would involve additional financial
commitment to the Government, as higher amount of compensation will have to be
paid. It was, therefore, proposed to amend the said Act suitably, with effect
from the 6th April 1960, to give effect to the intention that the amount
payable is determined for the family as a whole, with necessary provisions for
validating cases, conforming to the provisions of the Act as proposed to be
amended and for re-opening cases not conforming to the provisions of the Act
as proposed to be amended for disposal according to the provisions of the Act
as proposed to be amended.2\. It was also proposed to change the reference to
'compensation' in the Act as 'amount' so as to be consistent with the
provisions of Article 31(2) of the Constitution, with effect from the 20th
April 1972, that is, the date of coming into force of the Constitution
(Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971.3\. The amount payable for the surplus
lands taken over under Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961 was found in certain cases to
be higher than the market value of such land. This results in difficulty in
collecting the land value from the assignees of the surplus lands, as the
amount paid to the landowner is collected as land value from the assignees. It
was, therefore, proposed to change with prospective effect, the basis for
calculation of the amount as a multiple of the annual value, the annual value
being a suitable multiple of the land revenue with additions for irrigated dry
or manavari lands, subject to a maximum of Rs. 350 per acre, so that the
amount payable for the best category of land will not exceed Rs. 3,500 per
acre. In addition, tree value and value for buildings, machinery, etc., will
also be payable as laid down.4\. It was also considered necessary to take
power for the Government to constitute Land Tribunals with officers not below
the rank of District Revenue Officer also, to clear the accumulation of
appeals against the orders of the authorised officers, etc., and to empower
the Land Commissioner to transfer appeals, from one Land Tribunal to another
Land Tribunal wherever necessary.5\. The proviso to section 94 of the said
Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961, lays down that the rules for disposal of surplus
lands framed under that section shall not come into force unless they are
approved by the Legislature. In order to obviate the delay arising in view of
this provision in amending the rules, it was proposed to omit the said
proviso, and to provide that the rules be placed on the Table of both the
Houses of the Legislature after issue of the same.6\. Certain amendments with
reference to the administrative point of view were also proposed to be
made.7\. To give effect to the above proposals, the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Ordinance, 1978 (Tamil Nadu
Ordinance 14 of 1978), was promulgated by the Governor.8\. The Bill seeks to
replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 16th February 1979.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Second Amendment Act, 1979 (Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 1980). - Surplus lands
acquired under the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), can be assigned to a person under the Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Disposal of Surplus Land) Rules, 1965, up to a maximum of 5
standard acres. It has been brought to the notice of the Government that a
large extent of land, that is, exceeding 15 ordinary acres, but within the
admissible maximum of 5 standard acres, has been assigned to eligible persons
under the said rules. The present maximum limit of 5 standard acres was fixed
in the year 1965. The maximum limit for assignment of Government poramboke
land was reduced to 3 ordinary acres of dry land or 1-1/2 ordinary acres of
wet land with effect from the year 1971. Most of the surplus lands taken over
by the Government are cultivable and more valuable than poramboke or assessed
waste lands. If the maximum limit in the case of surplus lands is reduced as
in the case of poramboke land, a large number of persons will be benefited by
the scheme, of Land Reforms. It has, therefore, been proposed to reduce the
maximum extent of the said surplus lands to be assigned to an eligible person
under the said rules, from the existing 5 standard acres to 3 ordinary acres
of dry land or 1-1 /2 ordinary acres of wet land. The above proposal will
involve amendment to section 94(2)(a) of the said Act, as under the said
section, preference in the assignment of surplus land has to be given to any
person who is completely dispossessed of his holding or whose extent of
holding is reduced below 3 standard acres, held by him partly as cultivating
tenant and partly as owner or wholly as cultivating tenant, by virtue of the
provisions of the said Act.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve above
object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 29th October 1979.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1980
(Tamil Nadu Act 21 1980). - The exemption granted to lands used for the
cultivation of sugarcane by section 73 (xiii) of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), was
withdrawn by section 3 (10) of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 41 of 1971). Consequent
on such withdrawal, the Government constituted a Corporation as provided for
under section 94-A(2) of Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961 to administer the surplus
lands of Thiru Arooran Sugars Limited taken over by the Government. According
to section 94-B(l) of the said Act, any land which is held as tenant by any
sugar factory under a contract of tenancy which is subsisting and where such
land is within the ceiling area of the landowner concerned, such land shall be
deemed to be held as tenant by the Corporation for the unexpired period of the
contract, and accordingly the contract of tenancy shall be of as full force
and effect against the said Corporation, and may be enforced or acted upon as
fully and effectually as if in the place of the sugar factory, the Corporation
had been a party thereto. Under this provision, more than 3,000 acres of land
held on lease by Thiru Arooran Sugars Limited had been taken over by the Tamil
Nadu Sugarcane Farm Corporation Limited. The lease period of all the lease
lands held by the Corporation before the 30th June 1974 was extended for a
further period of five years from the date of the expiry of the period of such
lease by the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment
Act, 1975 (Tamil Nadu Act 11 of 1975).2\. By the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Ordinance, 1980 (Tamil Nadu
Ordinance 4 of 1980), the lease period was extended by one year from the date
of expiry of the lease period, pending alternative arrangements, if any, being
made for the supply of sugarcane to the sugar factory.3\. The period of lease
in respect of some of the lands, as extended by Tamil Nadu Ordinance 4 of
1980, is due to expire on the 30th June 1980. Due to the shortness of the time
for the Government to make any alternative arrangements for the supply of
sugarcane to the sugar factory, the Government have now decided to continue
the period of lease in respect of the lease lands held by the said Corporation
for a further period of two years from the date of the expiry of the period of
such lease as extended by the said Tamil Nadu Act 11 of 1975.4\. The Bill
seeks to replace the said Tamil Nadu Ordinance 4 of 1980 and to give effect to
the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 page 111 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 28th June 1980.Statement of Objects
and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Second
Amendment Act, 1980 (Tamil Nadu Act 8 Of 1980). - Under section 60 of the
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu
Act 58 of 1961), "cultivating tenant's ceiling area" means 5 standard acres
held by any person partly as cultivating tenant and partly as owner or wholly
as cultivating tenant. The Government have decided to reduce the cultivating
tenant's ceiling area under the said Act from 5 standard acres to 3 standard
acres and to include within the proposed reduced ceiling limit, not only the
lands held by a cultivating tenant as tenant or as owner or as possessory
mortgagee, but also such lands held by his spouse, minor sons and unmarried
daughters. The excess lands available under the proposed measure will not
revert to the landowner but they will be taken over and distributed by the
Authorised Officer on behalf of the Government in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter VIII of the said Act.2\. It has also been decided to
provide that for the purposes of In fixing the cultivating tenant's ceiling
area of any person under the Act, the leases, etc, made on or after the 17th
April 1979, but before the notified date shall be void.3\. To give effect to
the above decisions, the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Fourth Amendment Ordinance, 1979 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 23 of 1979), was
promulgated by the Governor.4\. The Bill seeks to replace the said

the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 28th June 1980.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act,
1981 (Tamil Nadu Act 59 of 1981). - The exemption granted to lands used for
the cultivation of sugarcane by section 73 (xiii) of the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961)
was withdrawn by section 3(10) of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 41 of 1971). Consequent
on such withdrawal, the Government constituted a Corporation, namely, the
Tamil Nadu Sugar-cane Farm Corporation limited, as provided for under section
94-A (2) of Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961 to administer the surplus lands of Thiru
Arooran Sugars Limited, taken over by the Government.2\. According to section
94-B(l) of the said Act, any land which is held as tenant by any sugar factory
under a contract of tenancy which is subsisting and where such land is within
the ceiling area of the landowner concerned, such land shall be deemed to be
held as tenant by the Corporation for the unexpired period of the contract,
and accordingly the contract of tenancy shall be of as full force and effect
against the said Corporation, and may be enforced or acted upon as fully and
effectually as if in the place of the sugar factory, the Corporation had been
a party thereto.Under this provision, the lands held on lease by Thiru Arooran
Sugars Limited had been taken over by the Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farm
Corporation Limited. The lease period of all the lease lands held by the said
Corporation before the 30th June 1974 was first extended for a period of five
years from the date of the expiry of the period of such lease by the Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1975 (Tamil
Nadu Act 11 of 1975). As it was considered necessary that the lease lands
should continue to be under the occupation of the said corporation for some
more time, to ensure regular supply of sugar-cane to the sugar factory, the
lease period was further extended for a period of two years by the Tamil Nadu
Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 1980 (Tamil Nadu Act
21 of 1980). The extended lease period in respect of some of the Lands was due
to expire on the 30th June 1981.3\. On the representation given by the owners
of the lease lands that these lands might be released to them, the Government
decided that except the lease lands which are interspersed with the Government
lands held by the Corporation, other lease lands should be released to the
landowners at the end of the fasli year ending with the 30th June 1981. As it
was not possible for the above work to be completed before the 30th June 1981,
the Government decided that the term of the lease hold extent be extended for
a further period of one year beyond the 30th July 1981, in general terms for
application to all lease lands and that at the same time the Corporation be
vested with powers to terminate the lease with the owners of the lands
concerned which are proposed to be released by the Corporation as and when
considered necessary, by suitably amending Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961.4\. To
give effect to the above decision, the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Amendment Ordinance, 1981 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 8 of 1981),
was promulgated by the Governor.5\. The Bill seeks to replace the said
Ordinance.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary,dated the 21st August 1981.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Act,
1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 2 of 1984). - Section 24 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961) provides
for the constitution of the Tamil Nadu Land Board consisting of, among other
members, one member of the Board of Revenue (other than the Land Commissioner)
nominated by the Government. Consequent on the abolition of the Board of
Revenue, there is no member of the Board of Revenue as such, to be so
nominated. It is, therefore, necessary to specify a suitable officer in the
place of the member of the Board of Revenue (other than the Land Commissioner)
as a member of the Tamil Nadu Land Board. The Government have proposed that
the Chief Conservator of Forests shall be included as an ex-officio member of
the Tamil Nadu Land Board in the place of the member of the Board of Revenue,
to represent the interests of the Forest Department when decisions are taken
by the Tamil Nadu Land Board.2\. According to sub-section (3) of section 24 of
the said Act, the Chairman of the Land Board shall be a judicial officer who
is, or is qualified for appointment as, or a person who has been, a judge of a
High Court, nominated by the Government. With the diminution in the work of
the Land Board, there is no need for a whole-time Chairman. For the residuary
and continuing work involved in watching the fulfilment of the conditions of
grant of permission under section 31 of the Act, the Land Board as an
institution is necessary, but it is no longer necessary to have a judicial
officer as a member or the Chairman of the Land Board. The Government have,
therefore, proposed that the Land Commissioner shall be the Chairman of the
Land Board.3\. Consequent on the abolition of the Board of Revenue, the
Government have also proposed to appoint the Commissioner of Land Reforms
instead of "any member of the Board of Revenue" as Land Commissioner for the
State under section 97 of the said Act, to exercise such powers and discharge
such duties as are assigned to him by or under the said Act.4\. The Bill seeks
to achieve the above objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu

and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment
Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 3 of 1984). - To speed up the implementation of the
Land Reform measures, the Government have decided to constitute a Special
Appellate Tribunal under Article 323-B of the Constitution under the name the
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal. It has been decided to
vest the Special Appellate Tribunal with powers to hear appeals and revisions
against the orders passed by the Land Tribunals under the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act, 58 of 1961),
and to omit the existing provisions providing for appeals and revisions to the
High Court. The Special Appellate Tribunal will also have revisionary powers
against any proceedings of the Land Board, and Land Commissioner. It has also
been decided that the Authorised Officer, Tamil Nadu Land Board, Land
Tribunal, Land Commissioner and Special Appellate Tribunal shall be the
hierarchy of Tribunals for purposes of clause (3)(a) of Article 323-B of the
Constitution. To give effect to the above decisions, it has been considered
necessary to amend the said Act suitably.2\. The Bills seeks to give effect to

provisions of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), no public trust and educational institution
can acquire any land. Representations have been received by the Government
that the above prohibition to acquire land imposed under the said Act has
hampered the growth of educational institutions and hospitals. The public
trusts, educational institutions and hospitals have not been able to acquire
land even for bona fide purposes, that is, for the establishment or for the
expansion of educational institutions and hospitals. It has, therefore, been
considered necessary to amend the said Act suitably taking power for the
Government to grant permission in favour of public trusts, educational
institutions and hospitals to hold or acquire land for such educational and
hospital purposes subject to the conditions that may be imposed by the
Government in the order granting such permission. To give effect to the above
proposal, it has been decided to amend the said Act suitably.2\. The Bill

37-B of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961
(Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961) recently inserted enables the Government to grant
permission, whether prospectively or retrospectively, in favour of public
trusts, educational institutions and hospitals to hold or acquire land for
educational and hospital purposes, subject to the conditions that may be
imposed by the Government in the order granting such permission. It has been
decided that the permission to be granted under the said section 37-B should
have only prospective effect. It has also been decided that such permission
shall be given only to public trusts and that the expression "hospital"
occurring in the said section 37-B should be defined. Accordingly, the Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Amendment Ordinance, 1987
(Tamil Nadu Ordinance 4 of 1987), was promulgated by the Governor.2\. The Bill

(Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), provide
for the imposition of fine amounts as penalties for certain offence punishable

Section 77-C of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), inter alia, provides for appointment of
Chairman, Vice-Chairman and a Member of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special
Appellate Tribunal by the Governor of the State after consultation with the
Chief Justice of India. Hon'ble Justice Thiru P. K. Sethuraman, appointed as
the Chairman of the said Tribunal, expired on the 24th July 1991. The existing
provisions of the said Act do not provide for making any interim arrangement
by authorising any person to act as Chairman in such an emergency till the
appointment of a new Chairman as provided in the said Act. It is, therefore,
proposed to amend the said Act so as to provide that in the event of the

Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals.Published in Part IV-Section
1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 25th April
1994.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Second Amendment Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 11 of 1996). -
Section 22 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), provides that any transfer or partition
made, on or after the date of the commencement of the Act, but before the
notified date, may be declared to be void by the authorised officer, if he
finds that such transfer or partition defeats any of the provisions of the
Act. In many cases, the authorised officers while implementing the Act have
passed orders under section 22 holding that the transfers or partitions
effected during the said period as void. The orders passed under section 22
have been taken on appeal to the Land Tribunal and the High Court, by parties
aggrieved. The High Court in a batch of cases in Civil Revision Petitions Nos.
1824,1825/65 and 44/66 has held that the transfer made during the said period
can be declared void only if the authorised officer can come to the conclusion
that the transaction is sham, nominal land bogus. The above judgement of the
High Court has been taken on appeal to the Supreme Court by the State
Government. However, during the pendency of appeal before the Supreme Court,
the authorised officers and the Land Tribunals have followed the judgment of
the Madras High Court and in many cases the transfer effected during the said
period have been, held to be valid.2\. Subsequently, the Supreme Court in the
appeal preferred by the State Government referred to above and reported in
Authorised Officer v. S. Naganatha Ayyar, AIR1979 SC 1487 has reversed the
judgment of the Madras High Court and interpreted section 22 of the Act to the
effect that if any transfer defeats the provisions of the Act by reducing the
extent of surplus land in excess of the ceiling available from any person such
transaction, bonafide or not, shall be void in the matter of computation of
permissible area and the surplus area.3\. Based 'on the said judgment of the
Supreme Court, many cases in which orders have been passed earlier holding the
transaction as valid, have been reopened and surplus land has been declared.
All the past cases which have been re-opened, are now challenged before the
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal on the ground that the Act
does not confer any right or power on the authorised officer to review such
cases which have reached finality.4\. It has, therefore, been decided to amend
section 22 of the said Act so as to be in consonance with the principles laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case referred to above and to make it clear
that if any transfer or partition, has the effect of reducing the extent of
surplus land in excess of the ceiling area, such transfer or partition whether
bonafide or not, shall be countered as defeating the provisions of the said
Act.5\. It has also been decided to make provisions for validating all acts
done or proceedings, taken by the authorised officer and to reopen the past
cases, based on the said judgment of the Supreme Court.6\. The Bill seeks to
give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 9th November 1994.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land)
Second Amendment Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 36 of 1998). - According to section
7 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961
(Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1961), no person shall be entitled to hold land in
excess of the ceiling area. The proviso to the said section stipulates that,
in calculating the total extent of land held by any person, any extent in
excess of the ceiling area and not exceeding half an acre in the case of wet
land and one acre in the case of dry land shall, irrespective of the
assessment of such land, be excluded. Some of the Land Tribunals have
interpreted the word "acre" occurring in the said proviso to mean standard
acre. If the word, "acre" in the said proviso is interpreted as "standard
acre", it will amount to allowing a person to hold 16 standard acres of land
or more in certain cases, whereas, only 15 standard acres can be held by a
person. Further, once it is construed as standard acre (which is computed with
reference to the principles specified in clause (40) of section 3 of the said
Act), then, the question of allowing half standard acre in the case of wet
land and one standard acre in the case of dry land, in excess of the ceiling
area, may amount to allowing double advantage in the case of dry land, in as
much as more ordinary acres will have to be allowed in case of dry land.2\.
Similarly in the third proviso to section 62 of the said Act, the extent of
excess land which can be excluded by the authorised officer in calculating the
cultivating tenants, ceiling area has been specified in acre only.3\. It has,
therefore, been decided to amend sections 7 and 62 of the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 so as to make it clear that
the word "acre" occurring in the proviso to the said section 7 and in the
third proviso to |he said section 62, is to mean, "ordinary acre" only.4\. The
Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1

Section 108 of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu 58 of 1961) provides for the payment of Court-fees for any
suit, appeal, application for revision, etc., to the Land Tribunal, Land
Commissioner or the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal. Taking
into account the abnormal increase in the cost of establishment, etc., it is
proposed to enhance the Court-fees leviable under the said section 108 of the
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961.2\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above proposal.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of
the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,dated the 23rd November
1998.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on Land) Amendment Act, 2003 (Tamil Nadu Act 26 of 2003). - The Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal has been constituted under the
Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu
Act 58 of 1961) for adjudication or trial of any dispute or complaint with
respect to land reform-matters arising under that Act. It started functioning
from 1-11-1990. Consequent on the formation of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
Special Appellate Tribunal, all the Writ Petitions and Civil Revision Petition
pending before the High Court of Madras relating to the said matter were
transferred to the Tribunal for disposal. The said Tribunal has appellate and
reversionary powers also.2\. The Staff and Expenditure Reforms Commission has
stated that the agriculture land reform legislation fixed ceilings as on 1960
and 1970 and the Urban Land Ceiling legislation has been repealed in 1999,
hence it is unlikely that a number of fresh appeals are to be filed. For the
last 4 years, this Tribunal did not have adequate work. Hence, Staff and
Expenditure Reforms Commission has recommended that the Tamil Nadu Land
Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal may be wound up.3\. The Government have
considered the said recommendation of the Commission and decided to wind up
the said Tribunal. Therefore, the Government have decided to amend the Tamil
Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 58
of 1961), suitably.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette

of Tamil Nadu] [Substituted for the word 'State of Madras' by the Tamil Nadu
Adaptation of Laws Order, 1969 as amended by the Tamil Nadu Adaptation of Laws
(Second Amendment) Order, 1969.].Whereas under clauses (b) and (c) of Article
39 of the Constitution of India, the State should, in particular, direct its
policy towards securing that the ownership and control of the material
resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common
good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the
concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment;And
Whereas the area of agricultural land available for cultivation in the State
is limited;And Whereas there is great disparity in the ownership of
agricultural land leading to the concentration of such land in the hands of
certain persons;And Whereas it is necessary to reduce such disparity in the
ownership of agricultural land in the State;And Whereas it is necessary to fix
a ceiling on the agricultural land holdings;And Whereas it is necessary to
acquire the agricultural land in excess of the ceiling area and to distribute
such land to the landless and other persons among the rural population;And
Whereas such distribution will best subserve the common good, increase
agricultural production and promote justice, social and economic;And Whereas
it is expedient to provide for all these and other matters connected
therewith;Be it enacted in the Twelfth Year of the Republic of India as
follows:-
