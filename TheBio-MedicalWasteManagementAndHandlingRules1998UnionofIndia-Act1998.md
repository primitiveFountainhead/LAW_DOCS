### 2\. The Combustion Efficiency is computed as follows :-

C.E.= | %C02 | X 100  
---|---|---  
%C02+ % CO  
  
### 3\. The temperature of the primary chamber shall be 800 ± 50°C.

### 4\. The secondary chamber gas residence time shall be at least 1 (one)
second at 1050 ± 50°C, with minimum 3% Oxygen in the stack gas.

bio-medical waste.(I)When operating a gravity flow autoclave, medical waste
shall be subjected to :-(i)a temperature of not less than 121°C and pressure
of 15 pounds per square inch (psi) for an autoclave residence time of not less
than 60 minutes; or(ii)a temperature of not less than 135°C and a pressure of
31 psi for an autoclave residence time of not less than 45 minutes; or(iii)a
temperature of not less than 149°C and a pressure of 52 psi for an autoclave
residence time of not less than 30 minutes.(II)When operating a vacuum
