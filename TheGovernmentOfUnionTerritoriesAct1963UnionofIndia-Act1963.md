Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies in the several Union Territories

Territory of Delhi) by the Delimitation Commission recently set up under the
Delimitation Commission Act, 1962.The Bill also seeks to amend the States
Reorganisation Act, 1956, so as to provide representations to the Union
Territories of Goa, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Pondicherry in
the Zonal Councils. - Gazette of India. 21-2-1963. Pt. II. Sec 2. Ext., page
75.Act 81 of 1971 :- On 3rd September 1970 it was announced in Parliament that
Government had decided, in principle, to grant Statehood to Manipur and
Tripura. Later, a similar announcement was made in respect of the autonomous
State of Meghalaya, On further consideration Government have come to the
conclusion that the Mizo District of Assam and the North-East Frontier Agency
should also be separated from the State of Assam and made into Union
territories to be known as Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, respectively.2\. The
Bill seeks to establish the new State of Manipur and Tripura, and form the new
State of Meghalaya and the new Union territories of Mizoram and Arunachal
Pradesh by reogranisation of the existing State of Assam. The Bill also seeks
to define the territories of the new States and Union territories and makes
the necessary supplemental, incidental and consequential provisions regarding
representation in Parliament and in the Legislative Assemblies of the States
and other matters. The Bill further provides for the constitution of a common
High Court for all the States in the north-eastern region and a common Bar
Council. The common High Court will also have jurisdiction in the new Union
territories.3\. As required by the proviso to Art. 3 of the Constitution, this
Bill was referred by the President to the Legislature of the State of Assam
for expression of its views.4\. The notes on clauses explain in detail the
various provisions of the Bill. Gas. of Ind.. 9-12-1971. Pt. 11, Section 2,
Ext.. p. 1012.Act 29 of 1975 :- There has been a growing desire among the
people of the Union territory of Arunachal Pradesh that(a) a Legislative
Assembly and a Council of Ministers should be constituted in that Union
territory;(b) the seats allotted to the Union territory in the Rajya Sabha and
the Lok Sabha should he filled by election instead of by nomination as at
present; and(c) with the introduction of direct elections the number of scats
allotted to the Union territory in the Lok Sabha should be increased to two
because of the difficult terrain and the vast area (83,578 sq. kms.) of the
Union territory.The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objectives through
amendteent of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, the
Representation of the People Act, 1950 and the Representation of the People
Act, 1951.2\. As delimitation of constituencies of the proposed Legislative
Assembly and holding of elections mas take time, it is proposed that the
Pradesh Council at present functioning in the Union territory shall function
as the Legislative Assembly until the Assembly is duly constituted after the
elections.3\. The opportunity to amend the Government of Union Territories
Act, 1963, is also proposed to be availed of to remove certain lacunae in
Sections 21 and 26 of the said Act.4\. The notes on clauses appended to this
Bill explain in detail the main provisions of the Bill - Gazette of India,
15-4-1975, Pt. II Section 2, Ext., p. 307.Act 86 of 1976:- As Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes had not been notified in relation to the Union territory
of Goa, Daman and Diu when the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, was
enacted, no provision was made in that Act for reservation of seats for the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of that
Union territory. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in relation to that
Union territory were notified in 1968 and the population figures of these
castes and tribes became available after the 1971 census. The Bill, therefore,
seeks to amend the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 to provide for
the reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the
Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu and to
empower the Election Commission to determine the number of seats to be so
reserved and the constituencies in which those seats shall be reserved.
Opportunity is also being availed of to delete the provision for reservation
for Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of
Pondicherry since no such tribes have been notified in relation to that Union
territory. - Gazette of India. 27-5-1976, Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., p. 968.Act
1 of 1980 :- The Votes on Account passed by Parliament in respect of the Union
territories of Pondicherry and Goa, Daman and Diu for the financial year
1979-80 were due to expire on 30th September, 1979 and 31st October. 1979,
respectively. It was expected that the full budgets of these territories could
be passed by their Legislative Assemblies, if reconstituted before those
dates, or by Parliament. However, the Lok Sabha was dissolved on 22nd August,
1979 and it was decided that elections to the new Lok Sabha and the new
Legislative Assemblies of Pondicherry and Goa, Daman and Diu should be held
simultaneously in January, 1980.2\. There was no provision in the Government
of Union Territories Act, 1963 for authorising any expenditure from the
Consolidated Funds of these territories in the absence of both the Assembly
and Lok Sabha. Hence the President promulgated the Government of Union
Territories (Amendment) Ordinance. 1979 (8 of 1979) on 25th September, 1979
for inserting in the said Act a provision, analogous to Article 357 (1) (c) of
the Constitution, io the effect that, where the Legislative Assembly of a
Union territory is dissolved, or its functioning as such Assembly remains
suspended, on account of an order under Section 51 of the Act, it shall be
competent for the President to authorise when the House of the People is not
in session expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of that Union territory
pending the sanction of such expenditure by Parliament.3\. The Bill seeks to
replace the said Ordinance. Gazette of India, 23-1-1990. Pt. II, Section 2,
Ext., p. 7.Act 19 of 1984 :- The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963,
requires that for the purposes of elections to the Legislative Assembly of the
Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, Pondicherry. Mizoram or Arunachal
Pradesh, the Union territory shall be divided into single member
constituencies in such manner that the population of each of the
constituencies shall, as far as practicable, be the same throughout the Union
territory. It also provides for delimitation of the constituencies, and for
reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes in the Legislative Assemblies of
the Union territories of Goa, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry and for the
Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Goa.
Daman and Diu. The figures of 1981 census being available, it may be argued
that it is necessary to delimit the constituencies for the purposes of
elections to the Legislative Assemblies of these Union territories on the
basis of the 1961 census. But as the process of delimitation of the
constituencies is quite time consuming, and as the holding of elections to the
Legislative Assemblies of some of the Union territories is urgently required
in view of the expiration of the period of duration of the existing
legislative Assemblies, it is necessary that elections are held to the
Legislative Assemblies of these Union territories on the basis of existing
constituencies, and reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes determined after the 1971 census, on the lints of similar provisions in
the Constitution of India relating to elections of Parliament and Legislative
Assemblies in the States. It is proposed to amend the Act suitably for this
purpose.2\. The period of duration of the existing Legislative Assembly of the
Union territory of Mizoram is expiring in the month of May. The necessary
notifications setting in motion the election process had therefore been issued
already. As there is no reservation of seats either for the Scheduled Castes
or for the Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of Mizoram, the
amendment providing for the conduct of elections on the basis of existing
constituencies alone is proposed to be made retrospectively, and actions
already taken for the purposes of elections to that Legislative Assembly are
proposed to be validated.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.Act
24 of 1985:- With a view to combating the evil of political detections and
preventing it from undermining the very foundations of own democracy and the
principles which sustain it, parliament enacted the Constitution (Fifty-Second
Amendment) Act, 1985, to include in the Constitution a new Schedule providing
for disqualification on ground of defection for membership of Parliament and
State Legislatures. This Bill seeks to amend the Government of Union
Territories Act, 1963, to provide for a similar disqualification for
membership of Legislative Assemblies of Union territories and to make the
provisions as to disqualification on ground of defection contained in the said
schedule applicable for the purpose.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
object.[10th May, 1963.]An Act to provide for Legislative Assemblies and
Councils of Ministers for certain Union territories and for certain other
matters.BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fourteenth Year of the Republic of
