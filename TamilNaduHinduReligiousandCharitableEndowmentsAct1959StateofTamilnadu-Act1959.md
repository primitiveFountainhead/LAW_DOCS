Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959(Tamil Nadu Act
22 of 1959)Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959). - The Madras
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951 (Madras Act XIX of 1951)
came into force on the 30th September 1951. After the Act came into force,
some of the sections of the Act were held ultra vires the State Legislature by
the High Court and the Supreme Court. Taking into consideration the judgments
of the High Court and the Supreme Court, the principal Act was amended
suitably by the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment)
Act, 1954 (Madras Act XXVII of 1954).Some of the sections of Madras Act XIX of
1951 as amended by Madras Act XXVII of 1954 require revision in view of the
later decisions of the High Court and the Supreme Court. Certain difficulties
were also experienced in the working of the Act by the Madras Hindu Religious
and Charitable Endowments (Administration) Department. It has been decided
that suitable provisions should be made in the Act so as to remove the above
difficulties, and also to remove the defects pointed out by Courts. As the
amendments for this purpose will be numerous, it is considered necessary to
replace the existing Act by a more comprehensive Act. It is also considered
necessary that the comprehensive Act should be made applicable to all Hindu
Public Religious institutions and endowments except the Incorporated Devaswoms
and Unincorporated Devaswoms in the Kanyakumari district and the Shencottah
taluk of the Tirunelveli district.The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 13th April 1959.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu
Act 12 of 1961). - Clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of section 9 of the
Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Madras Act 22 of
1959), prescribe the methods of recruitment to the posts of Commissioner and
Deputy Commissioners. The section as it stands does not permit appointment of
a person by promotion from the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments (Administration) Service. Consequently, Deputy Commissioners and
Assistant Commissioners are not eligible for promotion as Commissioner and
Deputy Commissioners, respectively. It is considered that the Deputy
Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners should not be deprived of the
prospects of promotion as Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners. It is also
considered that members of the Madras State Judicial Service should be made
eligible for appointment to the post of Commissioner and that Government
should have power to make appointment to the post of Deputy Commissioners also
by agreement or on contract basis.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 13th March 1961.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu
Act 29 of l972). - According to sub-section (1) of section 47 of the Tamil
Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959), the Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments shall
constitute a Board of Trustees consisting of not less than three and not more
than five persons appointed by him in respect of a listed religious
institution, that is a religious institution having an annual income of not
less than Rs. 20,000, if it has no hereditary trustee. Under section 49 of the
said Act, the Assistant Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments concerned has got similar powers for constituting the Board of
Trustees in respect of non-listed temples.2\. It is considered that as a
measure of social welfare and reform, a member of the Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled Tribes should be appointed to the Board of Trustees for temples.
Accordingly, it has been decided to make it obligatory that a member of the
Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes shall be appointed by the Commissioner to
the Board of Trustees of listed temples whether the total number of trustees
is three or five.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.Published in
Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated
1Oth August 1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1973 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1973). - At
present there are no rules governing the installation, maintenance, etc., of
hundials and other such receptacles in religious institutions. There is also
no express provision in the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), under which the rules can be
framed, for the above purpose. It is considered necessary that a uniform
procedure has to be followed in this regard. It has, therefore, been decided
to amend section 116 of the Act empowering the Government to make rules for
the installation, maintenance, etc., of hundials and other such receptacles in
religious institutions.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above
object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 21st March 1973.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Second Amendment) Act, 1973 (Tamil
Nadu Act 5 of 1974). - According to section 117 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), any
reference to the Board or its President or a Commissioner thereof contained in
any enactment in force in the State of Tamil Nadu or in any notification,
order, scheme, rule, form or by-law made under any such enactment and in force
in the State, shall, on and from the 30th September 1951, be construed as a
reference to the Commissioner appointed or deemed to have been appointed under
the Act.2\. The High Court, Madras, in its judgment in Writ Petition No. 1016
of 1970, has held that it is only the Commissioner, who can act as a
substitute for the Board under section 117 and the Assistant Commissioner has
initially no jurisdiction to call for applications for the appointment of non-
hereditary trustees. As such, the Commissioner alone is competent to appoint
trustees in that case. There may be several non-listed temples having schemes
with similar provisions and in all these cases, the Commissioner cannot
proceed to invite application. So, it is proposed to amend section 117 of
Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959 so as to empower the Commissioner, Hindu Religious
and Charitable Endowments, to delegate by order any of the powers devolved
upon him under that section to the Deputy Commissioner or Assistant
Commissioner as may be specified in such order.3\. The Bill seeks to achieve
the above object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated 29th November 1973.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Second
Amendment) Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 27 of 1974). - Sub-section (5) of section
87 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959
(Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) makes it obligatory on the part of the trustees of
the institutions concerned, to produce the accounts for audit. However, no
time-limit has been fixed for the production of the accounts for audit.2\. It
is considered that it will be quite possible for some trustees to avail of the
absence of a statutory time - limit so that they may either delay or evade the
production of accounts and that it is therefore absolutely necessary that a
time-limit is fixed for the production of accounts for audit. It has,
therefore, been decided to amend the said sub-section'(5) of section 37 of the
said Act so as to take power for the Government to make rules for fixing a
time-limit within which the accounts, records, etc., should be produced by the
trustee of the religious institution to the auditors for auditing.3\. The Bill
seeks to achieve the above object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated 9th April 1974.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
(Third Amendment) Act, 1974 (Tamil Nadu Act 50 of 1974). - Section 23 of the
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act
22 of 1959), confers on the Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments, the power of general superintendence and control in respect of
religious endowments and the power to pass orders which may be deemed
necessary for ensuring the proper administration of religious endowments. The
High Court, Madras, in Writ Petitions Nos. 3212 and 3213 of 1972, relating to
the validity of orders of amalgamation of temples passed by the Commissioner
under the said section 23 has, inter alia, held that the said section applies
only to religious endowments and it does not apply to religious institutions.
It is felt necessary to amend the said section 23 so as to include within its
scope temples and specified endowments attached thereto.2\. The Bill seeks to
achieve the above object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated 9th April 1974.Statement of Object and
Reason. - According to sub-section (1) of section 47 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), the
Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments shall constitute a
Board of Trustees consisting of not less than three and not more than five
persons appointed by him in respect of a listed religious institution, that
is, a religious institution having an annual income of not less than twenty
thousand rupees, if it has no hereditary trustee. Under section 49 of the said
Act, the Assistant Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
concerned has got similar powers for constituting the Board of Trustees in
respect of non-listed religious institutions.2\. When a religious institution
is included in the list published under section 46 of the said Act, the
Assistant Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments ceases to
have jurisdiction over such religious institutions and he cannot have power to
appoint trustees. The trustees appointed by the Assistant Commissioner at the
time when the religious institution was a no. - listed one can no longer
function as trustees after such religious institution has become a listed one.
It has therefore become necessary to make a suitable provision in the Act
empowering the Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments to
appoint a new set of trustees as soon as the religious institution is included
in the list published under section 46 of the said Act.3\. The Bill seeks to
achieve the above object.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated..............................Statement
of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
(Amendment) Act, 1991 (Tamil Nadu Act 46 of 1991). - A large number of small,
ancient and dilapidated temples which form part of our rich heritage are lying
uncared for. Many of these temples are in ruins. Lack of adequate finance has
led to this situation of neglect. It is, therefore, proposed to reorganise the
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department by the
establishment of Temple Administration Board so as to ensure proper
maintenance and administration of the temples besides observance of worship
and rituals in temples.2\. The endeavour is to have a two tier system of
administration, namely, Temple Administration Board at the apex level and a
District Committee at the district level. The Chief Minister will be the
Chairman ex-officio, of the Temple Administration Board. The over all
superintendence and governance of temples including appointment of trustees
for temples having an annual income of rupees one lakh and above are to be
vested with the Temple Administration Board and the power to appoint trustees
for temples having an annual income of less than rupees one lakh is to be
vested with District Committees. It is also proposed to entrust the powers of
the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner under the
Act, except certain powers of judicial nature, etc., with Temple
Administration Board and District Committees, suitably.3\. It is also proposed
to put an end to the term of office of non - hereditary trustees who are now
functioning as such in various temples and also to do away with the concept of
Regional Committee which hitherto prepared the panel of names for selection
for appointment to the Board of Trustees for religious institutions (other
than those religious institutions falling under clause (iii) of section 46) by
omitting section 46-A of the said Act.4\. To give effect to the above
proposals it is proposed to amend the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959).5\. The Bill seeks
to achieve the above objects.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 1st October 1991.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
(Amendment) Act, 1993 (Tamil Nadu Act 18 of 1993). - The Government have
upgraded the posts of Deputy Commissioner (Judicial) and Deputy Commissioner
(Inspection) as Joint Commissioners in the Office of the Commissioner, Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department, so as to lessen
the burden of work discharged by the Commissioner. There is, however, at
present no provision in the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) for enabling the Government
to appoint the Joint Commissioners. So, in order to appoint the Joint
Commissioners statutorily under the Act and to enable the Joint Commissioners
to exercise the powers and discharge the duties for carrying out the purposes
of the Act, it is proposed to amend the Act suitably.2\. The Bill seeks to
give effect to the above proposal.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated 29th April 1993.Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
(Second Amendment) Act, 1993 (Tamil Nadu Act 19 of 1993). - "District
Committee" has been defined in clause (8-A) of section 6 of the Tamil Nadu
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959), to mean the District Committee constituted under section 7-C of the
said Act. The nomenclature "District Committee" does not reflect that the
District Committee deals with the administration of temples. Hence, it is
proposed to change the nomenclature of the "District Committee" as the "Temple
Administration District Committee".2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the
above proposal.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated 29th April 1993.Statement of Objects and Reasons
- Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Third Amendment) Act,
1993. - The administration of Arulmigu Vedaranyeswaraswami temple in
Vedaranyam, Nagapattitaam Quaid-e-Milleth district is being carried out by a
trustee to be chosen by the "Varani Adheenam" in Jaffna district, Sri Lanka,
as per the scheme framed under sub-section (1) of section 64 of the Tamil Nadu
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959). It has now been decided to disqualify a person of foreign nationality
for being appointed as, and for being, a trustee of any religious institution
in Tamil Nadu. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend section 26 of the Tamil
Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959), suitably.2\. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.Published in
Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated
the 30th December 1993.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1993 (Tamil Nadu Act 18
of 1993). - According to section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), the provisions of
the said Act and the rules made thereunder may be extended to any Hindu or
Jain public charitable endowment, if the Government have reason to believe
that such endowment is being mismanaged, after conducting an enquiry in this
behalf. It is proposed to amend the said section 3 suitably, so that the
provisions of the said Act and the rules made thereunder may be extended to
any Hindu or Jain public charitable endowments even if they are not mismanaged
after issuing a notice to the persons interested in the public charitable
endowment concerned and after considering their objections, if any. It is also
proposed to make suitable provisions in the Act to the effect that while
exercising the power to extend the provisions of the said Act and the rules by
means of a notification, the Government shall do so only in the interests of
the public and to ensure that the income of the public charitable endowment is
duly appropriated and utilised for the purpose for which it was founded.2\.

the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 18th May
1993.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 39 of
l994). - According to clause (b) of section 7-K of the Tamil Nadu Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), any
non-official member of a Temple Administration District Committee, may, for
good and sufficient reason, be removed from the office, by the Temple
Administration Board. It is now proposed to vest with the Chairman of the
Temple Administration Board, the power to remove the Chairman if he is a non-
official and any other non-official member of a Temple Administration District
Committee and to vest with the Temple Administration Board the power to
supersede the Temple Administration District Committees, on the lines of the
provisions contained in section 64 of the Wakf Act, 1954 (Central Act 29 of
1954).2\. Under section 53 of the said Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959, the Tamil
Nadu Temple Administration Board and the Temple Administration District
Committees are empowered to suspend, remove or dismiss any trustee of any
religious institution within their jurisdiction. It is now proposed to give
such power to the Government also, in case of exigency, in view of experience
gained and the necessity felt consequent on the amendments made to the said
Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959 by Tamil Nadu Act 46 of 1991, and to make a
provision for appeal to High Court against the orders of the Government under
the powers referred to above. It is proposed to amend the said Tamil Nadu Act
22 of 1959 suitably for the above purposes.3\. The Bill seeks to give effect
to the above proposals.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 4th May 1994.Statement of Objects
and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment)
Act, 1995 (Tamil Nadu Act 38 of 1995). - The post of Joint Commissioner, Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department is one of the
authorities under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959). At present, there is one Joint
Commissioner in the Office of the Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Administration Department, besides seven Joint Commissioners
working as Executive Officers in seven Special Grade Temples. The Regional
Officers, namely, Deputy Commissioners cannot exercise control over the Joint
Commissioner (Executive Officer) and in view of this even routine,
administrative matters had to be disposed of by the Commissioner. Effective
supervision of the administration of all the temples including Special Grade
Temples is needed in the districts, which will be possible only if Joint
Commissioners are posted at the Regional Level and with powers which now vest
with the Deputy Commissioner of the Regions. So far, there is no provision for
appointing Joint Commissioners at Regional Level in the Act.2\. The Government
have, therefore, proposed to amend the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) to enable the
Joint Commissioners having jurisdiction over the area to exercise the powers
and perform the duties hitherto exercised by the Deputy Commissioners.3\. The

duties to the Temple Administration District Committee or the Commissioner.2\.
There are over 35, 000 temples in Tamil Nadu under the control of Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department. For effective
supervision of the administration of these temples, it is considered necessary
that the Temple Administration Board may be vested with powers to delegate
some of its powers to the field officers of the Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Administration Department such as Joint Commissioners, Deputy
Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners. The Government have, therefore,
proposed to amend the said section 7-O of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), suitably.3\. The
Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposal.Published in Part IV-Section 1
of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 8th November
1994.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments (Special Provisions) Act, 1996 (Tamil Nadu Act 23 of
1996). - Under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), the Temple Administration
District Committees and the Temple Administration Board, have been empowered
to appoint non-hereditary trustees in respect of all religious institutions
within their area of jurisdiction2\. In exercise of the powers vested under
the said Act, the Temple Administration District Committees and the Temple
Administration Board had appointed non - hereditary trustees to religious
institutions. However, discontent had been voiced on a large sale by the
general public in the matter of appointment of trustees made by the Temple
Administration District Committees and the Temple Administration Board and the
functioning of such trustees. In view of the general feeling of the public and
in public interest and for the proper maintenance and administration of the
religious institutions, it had been considered necessary by the Government to
remove the non-hereditary trustees so appointed, and fill up the vacancies by
fresh appointments, under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959.
Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Special
Provisions) Ordinance, 1996 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 3 of 1996) was promulgated
by the Governor to give effect to the above object and the same was published
in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 26th June
1996.3\. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part IV-
Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 16th
August 1996.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1996 (Tamil Nadu Act 39 of 1996). - The
establishment of Tamil Nadu Temple Administration Board and the Tamil Nadu
Temple Administration District Committees, has resulted in experiencing
difficulties in the effective implementation of the provisions of the Tamil
Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Act 21 of 1959).
Further, the powers of the Commissioner, Joint Commissioner, Deputy
Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, were totally crippled due to vesting of
overall powers, with the Chairman of the Temple Administration Board.2\. The
Government have decided to put an end to the two tier system of administration
in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department and
to restore the powers of the Commissioner, Joint Commissioner, Deputy
Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner for effective implementation of the
various provisions of the said Act and to amend the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious
and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959, for the purpose.3\. The Bill seeks to

22 of 1959), the administration and day-to-day affairs of religious
institution are carried on by the Executive Officer or the Chairman of the
Board of Trustees, as the case may be, on the basis of the resolution passed
by the trustee or the Board of Trustees. There is no provisions in the said
Act not to implement the resolution of the trustee or Board of Trustees by the
Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board of Trustees, as the case may be,
even if the resolution is not passed in accordance with law or is detrimental
to the interests of the Institution. The Government have, therefore, decided
to amend the said Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959 to insert a new section to enable
the Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, as the case
may be, to place the matter before trustee or Board of Trustees for
reconsideration, if, the resolution is found to be not in accordance with law
and is likely to be detrimental to the interests of the institution and also
to refer the matter to the Commissioner, Joint Commissioner, Deputy
Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner, as the case may be. The Government
have also decided to empower the Commissioner, Joint Commissioner, Deputy
Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner, to pass such order as he deems
fit, if the trustee or the Board of Trustees fails to reconsider the matter
and to specify that such order shall be final and binding on the trustee or
Board of Trustees and the Executive Officer.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect
to the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 21st May 1998.Statement of Objects

resolved that the Chairman of the Temple Administration Board may be empowered
to accord administrative sanction and approval of plans and estimate and
approval of tenders relating to Thiruppani works and other works, the value of
which exceeds one lakh of rupees but does not exceed fifty lakhs of rupees.2\.
It has, therefore, been proposed to vest the powers of administrative sanction
and approval of plans and estimates and approval of tenders relating to
Thiruppani works and other works, the value of which exceeds one lakh of
rupees but does not exceed fifty lakhs of rupees with the Chairman, of the
Temple Administration Board for the purpose of administrative convenience and
to quicken the execution of Thiruppani works and other works and to amend the

Commissioner to exercise the powers and discharge the duties for carrying out
the purposes of the Act, it is proposed to amend the said Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959, suitably.2\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
proposal.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 25th October 2002.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 2006
(Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 2006). - According to section 12 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), the
Commissioner, Additional Commissioner, Joint Commissioners, Deputy
Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners and other officers and servants
including Executive Officers of religious institutions employed for the
purpose of the said Act shall be servants of the Government and their salary,
allowances, pension and other remunerations shall be paid in the first
instance from out of the Consolidated Fund of the State. The Commissioner
shall repay to the Government the sums so paid from out of the Tamil Nadu
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Fund. But, in respect
of the salaries, etc., paid to the Executive Officers, the Commissioner shall
recover the sum so paid from the religious institutions concerned and credit
to the account of the said Fund.2\. As the Executive Officers are also
Government servants, it is considered that there is no need to differentiate
in the source for payment of their salary, etc., and the recoupment
subsequently. Moreover, recovery of the salary, etc., of the Executive
Officers directly from the temples affect the temples having medium and low
income as most of the income is just sufficient to pay the Executive Officer's
salary. The Government have, therefore, decided that the salary, etc., paid to
the Executive Officers from the Consolidated Fund of the State may be recouped
from the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration
Fund as in the case of all other officers and employees of the Hindu Religious
and Charitable Endowments Administration Department.3\. Section 92 of the said
Act provides for the liability of every religious institution to pay
contribution to the Commissioner annually from the income derived by it, not
exceeding eleven per centum of its income. Taking into consideration of the
increase in payment of salary, etc., to Officers, Servants including Executive
Officers, the Government have decided that the said ceiling limit may be
raised to twelve per centum per annum.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the
above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 21st January 2006.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Second
Amendment) Act, 2006 (Tamil Nadu Act 16 of 2006). - Section 7-A of the Tamil
Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959), provides for constituting District Committees for every Revenue
District for preparing a panel of names of persons for appointment as non-
hereditary trustees in the religious institutions. This section was introduced
by the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act,
1996 (Tamil Nadu Act 39 of 1996). On the basis of experience gained in the
past, it has been found that the District Committee system has not worked
satisfactorily. The Government have examined the matter carefully and they
consider that the District Committees failed to fulfil the purpose for which
they have been constituted. The Government have, therefore, decided that
District Committees should be abolished and the powers now exercised by the
District Committees should be conferred on the Government, Commissioner, Joint
Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, as the case may be. Accordingly, it is
proposed to omit section 7-A and to make consequential amendments to relevant
sections of the said Act.2\. Section 26(l)(b) of the said Act stipulates an
upper age limit of 70 years for a person to become eligible for appointment as
trustee in a religious institution. Since age is considered an indicator of
piousness, philanthropic attitude and sense of dedication, it has been decided
to delete the upper age limit for appointment of trustees provided under
section 26 of the said Act.3\. Section 47 of the Act provides for appointment
of one person belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in the Board of
Trustees of every religious institution. In the context of women taking keen
interest in the religious activities, their participation in the
administration of the temples is considered crucial for the development of the
religious institutions. Accordingly, suitable provision has been proposed to
be introduced in section 47 of the said Act, ensuring one woman in the Board
of Trustees of religious institutions.In the above context, it has become
necessary to give opportunities to senior citizens and women, and other
aspirants who, have the necessary aptitude, dedication and competence and to
strengthen and to provide impetus to the administration of the religious
institutions. The Government have carefully considered the matter and have
decided to reduce the term of office of the non-hereditary trustees from three
years to one year. Section 47(3) of the said Act is sought to be amended in
order to achieve this objective.4\. Archakas of the temples are to be
appointed without any discrimination of caste and creed. Custom or usage
cannot be a hindrance to this. It is considered that the position is clarified
in the Act itself and accordingly, it has been decided to amend section 55 of
the said Act suitably.5\. Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Ordinance, 2006 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 5 of
2006) was promulgated by the Governor on the 14th July 2006 and the same was
published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 16th
July 2006.6\. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part
IV-Section 1 of-the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the
12th August 2006.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious
and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 2007 (Tamil Nadu Act 13 of 2007). -
Sub-section (1) of section 7 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959), empowers the Government to
constitute an Advisory Committee to make recommendations on certain matters
relating to the administration of the religious institutions. Under clause (d)
of the said sub-section (1) of section 7, the Government may nominate non-
official members not exceeding eight along with the official members to the
said Advisory Committee in view of the larger interest of the institutions and
in getting the suggestions, various heads of mutts and experts from various
fields have to be accommodated in the Advisory Committee. The Government have,
therefore, decided to remove the restriction on the number of non-official
members to be nominated to the Advisory Committee by amending the said Act.2\.
The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.Published in Part IV-
Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, Extraordinary, dated the 20th
April 2007.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and
Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 2012. - As per Clause (18) of Section 6
of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil
Nadu Act 22 of 2012), religious institution means a math, temple or specific
endowment. The places of samadhi and brindhavan are not covered under the
provisions of the said Act. The places of samadhi and brindhavan established
in Tamil Nadu in memory of famous guru, sadhu or saint are being worshipped as
a place of public religious worship. These institutions have acquired the
status of religious institution and owning vast properties besides attracting
large number of worshippers. Barring a few, most of the samadhi and brindhavan
are not covered under any law. Though, a few such samadhi and brindhavan are
registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act 1975 (Tamil Nadu
Act 27 of 1975), they are not effectively controlled under the said Tamil Nadu
Act 27 of 1975. Therefore for effective supervision to bring those
institutions under the control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
Department, the Government have decided to include the places of samadhi and
brindhavan and other institutions established or maintained for a religious
purpose, where there is public religious worship, under the definition of the
term "religious institution" in Clause (18) of Section 6 of the said Act and
to bring out suitable amendment to Clause (15) of Section 6 of the said Act to
define "person having interest" in such religious institution.2\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decision.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Second Amendment) Act,
2012. - Section 7-A of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) which provided for
constitution of a District Committee for each revenue district to prepare a
panel of names for appointment of non-hereditary trustees to religious
institutions was omitted vide Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 2006. Since there are no
District Committees to select non hereditary trustees to the religious
institutions, there is inordinate delay in appointing non-hereditary trustees
and lack of transparency in the selection of qualified persons for the
appointment of non-hereditary trustees.2\. Now, in order to speed up the
appointment of non-hereditary trustees to the religious institutions and to
have transparency in their selection process, the Government have decided to
constitute District Committees, comprising of scholars, philanthropists, and
religious minded people to prepare panel of names for appointment of non-
hereditary trustees and to amend the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959) for the purpose.3\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decision.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 2013,
Dated 28.10.2013. - Sub-section (1) of section 26 of the Tamil Nadu Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959)
specifies the disqualifications for being appointed as and for being a trustee
of any religious institution. The disqualifications specified in sub-section
(1) of the said section 26 is a bar for being appointed as and for being a
trustee of a religious institution, only if the said disqualifications are
relatable to that particular religious institution. Now, the Government have
decided to specify that certain disqualification will bar a person from being
appointed as and for being a trustee of any religious institution or endowment
and certain disqualifications will bar a person from being appointed as, and
for being a trustee of the religious institution or endowment in respect of
which the disqualification is relatable. Accordingly, it has been decided to
amend sub-section (1) of section 26 of the Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959.2\. Sub-
section (2) of section 53 of the Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959 provides for
suspension, removal and dismissal of trustees of a religious institution on
acquiring disqualifications. Consequent on the amendment proposed to section
26 of the Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959, it has also been decided to amend clauses
(e), (i) and (j) of sub-section (2) of section 53 of the Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1959 suitably.3\. Besides the disqualifications specified in section 26 of the
Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959 for being appointed as and for being a trustee, it
has been decided to specify certain qualifications for appointment as trustees
and for being a trustee to any religious institution. Accordingly, it has been
decided to insert a new section specifying the qualifications for being
appointed or for being a trustee of any religious institution.4\. The Bill
seeks to give effect to the above decision.Received the assent of the
President on the 19th November 1959 and first published in the Fort St. George
