## Chapter 3  
General

### 3. Overview.

(1)Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Supply are the main functions in
an Electric system. Irrespective of whether there are different wings under
the control of the same management or independent companies and Licensees for
these functions, as envisaged in Electricity Act 2003, the quality of service
rendered to the end user depends upon the function of each wing. This Code
defines the main functions connected with the Intra State Transmission System
and also lays down the rules, the guidelines and standards to be followed by
the various players (agencies and participants) in the system to plan,
develop, expand, maintain and operate the power system in the most efficient,
reliable, safer and economic manner. This Code is consistent with the Indian
Electricity Grid Code (IEGC) and Grid Standards formulated under various
regulations by CEA.(2)Objective: The objective of the Code is to define the
services rendered by each wing in the overall electric system and also for
identifying the responsibility and performance factor and measurement points
for each one of them. Further it facilitates intra state transmission and
wheeling of electricity, with a focus on the operation, maintenance,
development and planning of the Tamil Nadu State Electricity Grid. This Code
brings out a single set of technical requirements encompassing all the
Generators, Licensees, and State Transmission Utility connected to or related
to or using the Intra State Transmission System and provides the following:The
documentation of the principles and procedures, which define the relationship
between various users of the Intra State Transmission System and State Load
Despatch Centre as well.• Responsibilities and obligation with respect to the
operation of the State Transmission System (STS).• Suitable measures for
connectivity with the Grid for all generating plants.• The standards with
reference to quality, continuity and reliability of service for compliance by
the Licensees.• Planning of the State Electricity Grid and making arrangements
for its operation, maintenance, development and expansion.• Operation of Grid
under normal, abnormal and emergency conditions.• Procedures for black start,
fast restart, restoration of supply after major disturbances.• Penalty for the
non-compliance of this Grid Code, Grid Standards and the lawful directions of
RLDC and SLDC.• Facilitation for beneficial trading of electricity by defining
a common basis of operation of the Intra State Transmission System applicable
to all the users of the system.• To ensure economy and efficiency in the
operation of the power system in the State.• To achieve compliance with the
Grid Standards and other relevant Standards, Codes, Regulations and direction
of SLDC by every licensee and others involved in the operation of the power
system.(3)Structure of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Grid Code: The Code is
structured in distinct chapters as follows:(a)Functional responsibilities of
entities connected with the State Grid(b)System Planning(c)Grid Connectivity
conditions(d)Requirement in Grid Operation(e)Scheduling and
Despatch(f)Commercial issues and Implementation(g)Non Compliance(4)General
Requirements: The Grid Code contains procedures to permit equitable management
of day to day technical situations in the Electricity Supply System, taking
into account a wide range of operational situations and requirements likely to
be encountered under both normal and abnormal conditions.It is nevertheless
necessary to recognize that the Grid Code cannot predict and address all
possible operational situations. Users must therefore understand and accept
that, in such unforeseen circumstances, the State Transmission Utility (STU)
who has to play a key role in the implementation of the Grid Code may be
required to act decisively for maintaining the Grid regimes for discharging
its obligations. Users shall provide such reasonable co-operation and
assistance as the STU may request in such circumstances.(5)Application of
other Codes etc.,(i)This code shall be read along with the, Tamil Nadu
Electricity Supply Code, Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code, and other
relevant provisions of the Act, along with amendments thereon, rules and
regulations made there under.(ii)Where any of the provisions of this Code is
found to be inconsistent with those of the Act, rules or regulations made
there under, not withstanding such inconsistency, the remaining provisions of
this Code shall remain operative.(iii)Where any dispute arises as to the
application or interpretation of any provisions of this Code, it shall be
referred to the Commission whose decision shall be final and binding on the
parties concerned.(iv)Wherever extracts of the Electricity Act, 2003, are
reproduced, any changes / amendments to the original Act shall automatically
be deemed to be effective under this Code also

## Chapter 5  
System Planning

### 5. System Planning.

(1)The System Planning specifies the policy and procedures to be applied in
planning of Tamil Nadu State Grid. The Users of the State Transmission System
shall take the "System Planning" into account for planning and development of
their own System. A requirement for reinforcement or extension of the State
Transmission System may arise for a number of reasons, including but not
limited to the following:(i)Development on a User's system already connected
to the State Transmission System.(ii)The introduction of a new Connection
point between the User's system and the State Transmission
System.(iii)Evacuation system for Generating Stations within or outside the
State.(iv)Reactive Power Compensation.(v)A general increase in system capacity
(due to addition of generation or system load) to remove operating constraints
and maintain standards of security.(vi)Transient or steady state stability
considerations.(vii)Cumulative effect of any of the above.Accordingly, the
reinforcement or extension of the State Transmission System may involve work
at an entry or exit point (Connection Point) of a User to the State
Transmission System. Since development of all User's systems must be planned
well in advance to permit consents and way leaves to be obtained and detailed
engineering design/construction work to be completed, STU will require
information from Users and vice versa. To this effect, the system planning
imposes time scale for exchange of necessary information between STU and Users
having regard, where appropriate, to the confidentiality of such
information.(2)Objective: The provisions of this section are intended to
enable STU to evolve a plan in consultation with Users, to provide an
efficient, coordinated, secure and economical State Transmission System to
satisfy requirement of future demand. The System Planning• Defines the
procedure for the exchange of information between STU and a User in respect of
any proposed development on the User's system, which may have an impact on the
performance of the User.• Details the information which STU shall make
available to Users in order to facilitate the identification and evaluation of
opportunities for use of or connection to State Transmission System;• Details
the information required by STU from Users to enable STU to plan the
development of its Transmission System to facilitate proposed User
developments;• Specifies planning and design standards, which will be applied
by STU in planning and development of the power system.(3)Planning Policy: STU
would develop a perspective transmission plan for next 10 years for State
Transmission System. These perspective transmission plans would be updated
every year to take care of the revisions in load projections and generation
capacity additions. The perspective plans shall be submitted to Commission for
approval. STU shall carry out annual planning process corresponding to a
5-year forward term for identification of major State Transmission System.
Both the long term and short term plans shall fit into National Electricity
Plan formulated by Central Government, perspective plan developed by CEA,
Electric Power Survey of India published by the CEA, and long term / short
term plans prepared by Central Transmission Utility.(4)Planning Procedure: STU
shall adopt the following steps in system planning.(i)Forecast the demand for
power within the Area of Supply, based on the forecasts provided by
distribution licensees, and provide to the Commission details of the demand
forecasts, data, methodology and assumptions on which the forecasts are based.
For demand forecasting, the methodology and procedure followed by the Electric
Power Survey Committee constituted by CEA may be followed. These forecasts
would be annually reviewed and updated. The primary responsibility of load
forecasting within distribution licensee's Area of Supply rests with
respective distribution licensees. The distribution licensees shall determine
peak load and energy forecasts of their areas for each category of loads for
each of the succeeding 5 years and submit the same annually by 31st March to
STU along with details of the demand forecasts, data, methodology and
assumptions on which the forecasts are based along with their proposals for
transmission system augmentation. The demand forecasts shall be updated
annually or whenever major changes are made in the existing forecasts or
planning. While indicating requirements of single consumers with large demands
(1 MW or higher) the distribution licensee shall satisfy himself as to the
degree of certainty of the demand materializing.(ii)The STU shall work out on
the basis of projected loads and losses of the system, the net energy
requirement and peak load requirement at generation end. The installed
capacity, peak availability, surplus and deficit both in demand and energy
shall also be worked out by the STU.(iii)Workout the additional generating
capacity required after taking into account, the existing capacity, assistance
from captive power plants, projects under construction, proposed projects
under IPPs (Independent Power Producers) in the State sector and share of the
State from Central sector Power Projects both within and outside Tamil
Nadu.(iv)Prepare a proposal for the requirement of generation for the State to
meet the load demand as per the forecast, after examining the economic;
technical and environmental aspects of all available alternatives taking into
account the existing contracted generation resources and effects of demand
side management.(v)The plan shall indicate the areas opened up for private
investors / generation expansion so as to facilitate decision on private
investment.(vi)Prepare a transmission plan for the State Transmission System
compatible with the above load forecast and generation plan. This will include
provision for VAR compensation needed in the State Transmission System. The
reactive power planning exercise is to be carried out by STU in consultation
with RLDC/SREB and distribution licensees.(vii)STU's planning department shall
use load flow, short circuit, transient stability study, relay coordination
study and other techniques for transmission system planning.(viii)STU's
planning department shall simulate the contingency and system constraint
conditions for the system in transmission system planning.(ix)STU would
maintain a historical database based on operational data supplied by SLDC
using the state-of-the-art tools such as Energy Management System (EMS) for
demand forecasting.(x)STU shall be responsible to prepare and submit a long-
term (10 years) plan to the Commission for the requirement of generation
expansion and transmission system expansion to meet the future demand growth.
The proposal for setting up of generating plant would be prepared after
examining the economic, technical & environmental aspects.(xi)All the Users
shall supply to STU, the desired planning data by 31st March every year to
enable STU to formulate and finalize the plan by 30th September each year for
the next 5 years.(xii)The plan reports shall contain a Chapter on additional
transmission requirement, which may include not only intra-State transmission
lines but also additional equipment such as transformer, capacitors, reactors
etc.(xiii)The plan report shall also indicate the action taken to fulfill the
additional requirement and actual progress made on new schemes. The planning
report and power map will be available to any interested party for making
investment decision/connection decisions to the STS.(xiv)To provide long-term
open access as per the terms and conditions formulated by TNERC.(xv)Based on
Plans prepared by the STU, other Transmission / distribution licensees shall
have to plan, their systems to further evacuate power from the STS. In case of

State transmission system to absorb/evacuate power beyond STS, the applicant
shall co-ordinate with CTU.(xvi)The Inter-State Transmission System and
associated intra-State trans-mission system are complementary and inter-

performance.Therefore, the development of associated intra-State transmission
system shall also be in line with the development of Inter-State Transmission
System.(5)Planning Standards: The State Transmission System planning and
generation expansion planning shall be in accordance with the provisions of
the Planning Criterion as per IEGC. However, some planning parameters of the
State Transmission System may vary according to directives of TNERC and State
specific requirements.(6)Generation Planning: (a) The generation planning
mainly concerns with the expansion of the generating network and the special
focus are:• Capacity addition by the distribution licensee, IPPs, Co-
Generators and Captive Generators.• Flows from central sector power stations.•
Expected power flow through Trading of Power.• Adoption and effectiveness of
Demand Side Management and Energy Conservation Measures.• Optimization of
existing capacity through renovation and modernization.• Utilizing the off
peak surplus from base load station for the pumped storage plants during pump
mode operation.• Environmental and financial constraints.• Fuel prices and
availability.(b)The important key issues with respect to the generation
planning are.• Predicting the establishment of new generation capacity,
including where, when and how much.• Predicting generation despatch.•
Provision towards generation reserve for reliability of supply.• Predicting
decommissioning of old generation capacity.• Environmental regulation leading
to an increasing amount of renewable energy sources generation with
prioritized Grid access.• The impact of wind energy generators, Co-Generators
and Captive generation units on the dynamic performance of the power system
considering its special nature.• Impact of large generating plant on the
Grid.• Increasing amount of non-despatchable generation.• Marginal costs for
generators.• Price elasticity of consumers.• Market player's estimates of
future power prices.• Rules for access to the capacity on the
interconnection.(c)The STU shall analyze the planning problem by making use of
software models, simulation programs etc., of power system engineering.
Possible applications are:• Predicting the generation capacity and despatch by
including system reliability, marginal generation costs, future electricity
price and future environmental policy, through dedicated models.• Simulation
of different scenarios in capacity development and generation despatch for the
development of a flexible transmission grid structure.• Integrated resource or
least cost planning methods to evaluate the potential capacity addition
resources and uncertainties and to determine the best mix of sources.•
Probability methods for generation planning by representing generating unit
failure and repair processes, load variability due to weather and other
uncertainties.Note: Many hydro stations in Tamil Nadu are tied up with
irrigation schedules and these stations have to be closed down during certain
period of the year. Also in case of monsoon failure, many hydro stations

for overall efficient and trouble free Grid operation. A close relation exists
between voltage instability and reactive power compensation. Hence the
planning for reactive power compensation is also a system-planning problem and
needs careful study. STU shall carry out planning studies for Reactive Power
Compensation of STS including reactive power compensation requirement at the
Generating Station's Switchyard. Normally, while planning the system, the
degree of reactive power compensation is considered at load points by keeping
an eye on target power factor assigned, the load power factor and the
supply/absorption of reactive power from the various elements in the system.
It is considered a good practice of not drawing any reactive power from the
remote ends but meeting all the requirements locally. Flattening the nominal
voltage across the system shall be achieved by the optimal use of reactive
power compensation in the network so as to improve the voltage profile across
the system and is a measure of balance between the reactive power generated
and absorbed in the system.(b)The operative power factor of the generators in
the network shall be between 0.85 lagging and 0.95 leading for good reactive
power supply capability for local loads and should not generally be used for
remote despatching of reactive power.(c)The quantum of compensation required
to be provided in the Grid shall be suitably distributed in the transmission
system, sub stations and distribution system of network. The norms for
percentages and quantum of MVAr to be provided by the Licensees / Generators
for different period must be specified by STU through well-documented
guidelines for use by all concerned.(11)Planning Data: For System Planning
ISGS/State Generating Companies/ IPPs/licensees are to supply two types of

Requirements In Grid Operation

### 7. Introduction.

(1)In order to ensure the integrated operation of the State Electricity Grid
and to enhance the overall operational economy and reliability of the electric
power network spread over the entire State, the following operation guidelines
have been specified. It covers the real time operation of the State
Electricity Grid with all its interconnections to the neighboring State Grids.
It applies to all the constituents of the State Electricity System, STU, SLDC,
CTU, RLDC, Generators, IPPs and other agencies who are connected to the Grid.
It also applies to the agencies who intent / plan to generate, transmit and
distribute the electrical energy and become a constituent of the State
Electricity Grid.(2)Basic Policy: The primary objective of integrated
operation of the State Grid is to enhance the overall operational economy and
reliability of the entire electric power network spread over the geographical
area of the State. The real time operation of the State Grid shall be
supervised from the State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC). The roles of SLDC and
STU shall be in accordance with the provisions of Act 2003. All State entities
shall comply with these operation guidelines and coordinate with each other,
for deriving maximum benefits from the integrated operation and for equitable
sharing of obligations. A set of detailed internal operating procedures for
the State Grid shall be developed and maintained by the SLDC in consultation
with the STU and other State entities and shall be consistent with TNEGC and
IEGC. The control rooms of the SLDC, all SSLDCs, Power Plants, EHV and HV sub-
stations and any other control centers of all State entities shall be
controled round the clock and manned by trained and qualified personnel
wherever necessary. The SLDC shall develop methodologies / mechanisms for
daily / weekly / monthly / yearly demand estimation (MW, MVAr and MWh) for
operational purposes. The data for the estimation shall also include load
shedding, power cuts etc., SLDCs shall also maintain historical database for
demand estimation. The demand estimates are to enable the SLDC to conduct
system studies for operational planning purposes.(3)System Security Aspects:
(i) The Tamil Nadu Electricity Grid shall be operated as a synchronized
system. All State entities shall operate their respective power systems and
power stations in synchronism with the Grid. Appropriate security standard
will be adopted in the operation of the system. Reliability criteria will also
be adopted.(ii)No element/part of the Grid shall be deliberately isolated from
the rest of the State Grid or islanded except:• under an emergency, and
conditions in which such isolation would prevent a total Grid collapse and /
or enable early restoration of power supply,• when serious damage to a costly
equipment is imminent and such isolation would prevent it,• when such
isolation is specifically directed by SLDC or with specific prior approval
from SLDC Complete re-synchronization of the Grid shall be restored as soon as
the normal conditions are restored. The restoration process shall be
supervised by SLDC, as per the approved operating procedures separately
formulated.(iii)The list of such important Grid link/elements on which the
above stipulations apply shall be prepared and be available at SLDC / SSLDCs.
In case of opening / removal of any important element of the Grid under an
emergency situation, the same shall be communicated to SLDC at the earliest
possible time after the event.(iv)Any tripping, whether manual or automatic,
of any of the above elements of State Grid shall be precisely intimated by the
concerned entities to SLDC as soon as possible, say within ten minutes of the
event. The reason (to the extent determined) and the likely time of
restoration shall also be intimated. All reasonable attempts shall be made for
the elements' restoration as soon as possible.(v)All generating units, which
are synchronized with the Grid, irrespective of their ownership, type and
size, shall have their governors in normal, preferably at free-governor mode
at all times. If any generator of over 50 MW rating is required to be operated
without its governor in normal operation, the SLDC shall be immediately
advised about the reason and duration of such operation. All governors shall
have a droop between 3 %. and 6 % for thermal and 0 to 10 % for hydro
generators.(vi)Facilities available with load limiters, Automatic Turbine Run
up System (ATRS), turbine supervisory control, coordinated control system,
etc., shall not be used to suppress the normal governor action in any manner.
No dead bands and / or time delays shall be deliberately introduced.(vii)All
generating units, operating at / up to 100% of their Maximum Continuous Rating
(MCR) shall normally be capable of (and shall not in any way be prevented
from) instantaneously picking up 5% of extra load and sustain the increase for
a minimum of 5 minutes when frequency falls due to a system contingency. The
generating units operating at above 100% of their MCR shall be capable of (and
shall not be prevented from) going at least up to 105% of their MCR when
frequency falls suddenly. After an increase in generation as above, a
generating unit may ramp back to the original level at a rate of about one
percent (1%) per minute, in case continued operation at the increased level is
nol sustainable. Any generating unit of over fifty (50) MW size, not complying
with the above requirement, shall be kept in operation (synchronized with the
State Grid) only after obtaining the permission of SLDC. However, the entity
can make up the corresponding shortfall in spinning reserve by maintaining an
extra spinning reserve on the other generating units of the entity.(viii)The
recommended rate for changing the governor setting, i.e. supplementary control
for increasing or decreasing the output (generation level) for all generating
units, irrespective of their type and size, would be one (1.0) per cent per
minute or as per manufacturer's limits. However, if frequency falls below 49.5
Hz, all partly loaded generating units shall pick up additional load at a
faster rate, according to their capability.(ix)Except under an emergency, or
to prevent an imminent damage to personnel and equipment, no entity shall
suddenly reduce his generating unit output by more than one hundred (100) MW
without prior intimation to and consent of the SLDC, particularly when
frequency is falling or is below 49.0. Similarly, no entity shall cause sudden
increase in its load by more than one hundred (100) MW without prior
intimation to and consent of the SLDC.(x)All generating units shall normally
have their Automatic Vqltage Regulators (AVR) in operation, with appropriate
settings. *In particular, if a generating unit of over fifty (50) MW size is
required to be opera ted without its AVR in service, the SLDC shall be
immediately intimated about the reason and duration, and its permission
obtained. Power System Stabilizers (PSS) in AVRs. of generating units
(wherever provided), shall be got properly tuned by the respective generating
unit owner as per a plan prepared for the purpose by the STU from time to
time. STU will be allowed to carry out checking of PSS and suggests further
tuning, wherever considered necessary.(xi)Provision of protections and relay
settings shall be coordinated periodically throughout the State Grid, as per a
plan to be separately finalized by the STU in coordination with all
entities.(xii)All entities shall put in all possible efforts to ensure that
the Grid is operated within the frequency limits prescribed by the
implementation of Availability Based Tariff (ABT) i.e. frequency always
remains within the 49.0 - 50.5 Hz band.(xiii)All State entities shall provide
automatic under-frequency load shedding, based on the operation of df/dt or
constant frequency setting relay in their respective systems, to arrest
frequency decline that could result in a collapse / disintegration of the
Grid, as per the plan separately finalised by SLDC in consultation with STU,
and shall ensure its effective application to prevent cascaded tripping of
generating units in case of any contingency. All entities shall ensure that
the under-frequency load shedding / islanding schemes are functional and no
under-frequency relay is bv-passed or removed without prior consent of
SLDC.(xiv)Procedures shall be developed by SLDC in consultation with STU, to
recover from partial / total collapse of the Grid and periodically updated in
accordance with the requirements given under Code 7 (5) (f). These procedures
shall be followed by all the entities to ensure consistent, reliable and quick
restoration.(xv)Each entity shall provide adequate and reliable communication
facility internally and with other entities/ SLDC to ensure exchange of data /
information necessary to maintain reliability and security of the Grid.
Wherever possible, redundancy and alternate path shall be maintained for
communication along important routes, e.g. SLDCs to SSLDCs and generating
stations.(xvi)The entities shall send information / data including disturbance
recorder / sequential even recorder output etc., to SLDC for purpose of
analysis of any Grid disturbance / event. No State entity shall block any
data/ information required by the SLDC for maintaining reliability and
security of the Grid and for analysis of an event.(xvii)Only authorized
persons as certified by STU can give/take line clear on Grid equipment and
lines for maintenance/fault rectification works. For carrying out erection/
repair in the circuit above 230 kV the competent person should have a minimum
operating experience of one year.(xviii)Before undertaking hot line
working/hot line washing of the insulators connected with Grid equipment,
advance information should be given to SLDC and other operating personnel
concerned.(xix)All entities shall put in all possible efforts to ensure that
the Grid voltage always remains within the following operating range.

Nominal | Maximum | Minimum  
---|---|---  
| Voltage in (kV rms) |   
400 | 420 | 360  
230 | 255 | 210  
110 | 120 | 100  
  
(xx)The steady state and transient stability limits of the Grid should be
communicated periodically.(xxi)There should be adequate spinning reserve in
the system.(xxii)The STU should provide power for maintenance, short term and
emergency to the IPPs and other non utility generators in accordance with the
connection agreement entered into.(4)Demand Control: Demand control is
concerned with the provisions to be made by SLDC to ensure the reduction of
demand in the event of insufficient generating capacity, and transfers from
external interconnections being not available to meet demand, or in the event
of breakdown or operating problems (such as frequency, voltage levels or
thermal overloads) on any part of the Grid.Towards this end the following
requirements shall be complied with:(i)Power drawing entities shall endeavor
to restrict their net drawal from the Grid to within their respective drawal
schedules whenever the system frequency is below 49.5 Hz. When the frequency
falls below 49.0 Hz., requisite load shedding (manual) shall be carried out to
curtail the over drawal. Such load shedding shall be pre-planned for each
level of under frequency.(ii)Further, in case of certain contingencies and /
or threat to system security, the SLDC may direct the SSLDCs and other sub
stations to decrease its drawal by a certain quantum. Such directions shall
immediately be acted upon.(iii)Each distribution licensee shall make
arrangements that will enable manual demand disconnection to take place, as
instructed by the SLDC /SSLDC, under normal and / or contingent conditions.
The measures taken to reduce the entities' drawal from the Grid shall not be
withdrawn as long as the frequency / voltage remains at a low level, unless
specifically permitted by the SLDC / SSLDC.(5)Operational Liaison (a)
Operations and events on the State Grid: Before any operation is carried out
on the State Grid, the SLDC will inform each participating entity, whose
system may, or will, experience an operational effect, and give details of the
operation to be carried out. Immediately following an event in the State Grid,
the SLDC will inform each State entity, whose system may/ or will, experience
an operational effect following the event and give details of what has
happened in the event but not the reasons why.(b)Operations and events on an
entity's system: Before any operation is carried out on an entity system, the
entity will inform the SLDC, in case the State Grid may, or will, experience
an operational effect, and give details of the operation to be carried out.
Immediately following an event on an entity system, the entity will inform the
SLDC, in case the State Grid may, or will, experience an operational effect
following the event, and give details of what has happened in the event but
not the reasons why.(c)Periodic Reporting: A weekly report shall be issued by
SLDC to all entities of the State and STU and shall cover the performance of
the State Grid for the previous week. The weekly report shall contain the
following:(i)Frequency profile showing the maximum and minimum frequency
recorded daily and daily frequency variation index (FVI)(ii)Voltage profile of
selected substations.(iii)Major Generation and Transmission outages and
constraints.(iv)Instances of persistent/significant non-compliance of TNEGC
The SLDC shall also prepare a quarterly report, which shall bring out the
system constraints, reasons for not meeting the requirements, if any, of
security standards and quality of service, along with details of various
actions taken by different agencies, and the agencies responsible for causing
the constraints.(d)Outage Planning: It is assumed that the list of elements of
the Grid as per Annexure C-l and Annexure C-2 covered under these requirements
shall be prepared and be available with SLDC for the proper implementation of
the outage planning exercises. The objective of outage planning are:• To

considering all the available resources and taking into account transmission
constraints, as well as irrigational requirements.• To minimize surplus or
deficits, if any, in the system requirement of power and energy and help
operate the system within Security Standards.• To optimize the transmission
outages of the elements of the State Grid without adversely affecting the Grid
operation but taking into account the generation outage schedule, outages of
constituent systems and maintaining system security standards.Outage planning
is prepared in advance for the current year and reviewed during the year on
quarterly and monthly basis.(e)Outage Planning Process:(i)SLDC shall be
responsible for analyzing the outage schedule given by all State constituents,

plan for the following financial year by 31st January of each year.(ii)The
STU, the IPPs, Generating Companies and Independent Private Transmission
Companies (IPTCs) shall provide SLDC their proposed, outage programs in
writing for the next financial year by 30th November of each year. These shall
contain identification of each generating unit / line / ICT, the preferred
date for each outage and its duration and where there is flexibility, the
earliest start date and latest finishing date.(iii)SLDC shall then come out
with a draft outage programme for next financial year by 31st December of each
year for the State Grid taking into account the available resources in an
optimal manner and to maintain security standards. This will be done after
carrying out necessary system studies and, if necessary, the outage programmes
shall be rescheduled. Adequate balance between generation and load to be
ensured while finalizing outage programmes.(iv)The final outage plan shall be
intimated to all entities for implementation latest by 31st January of each
year or by such earlier date as may be mutually decided by STU/SLDC.(v)The
above outage plan shall be reviewed by SLDC / STU on quarterly and monthly
basis in coordination with all parties concerned.(vi)In case of emergency in
the system viz., loss of generation, break down of transmission line affecting
the system, Grid disturbance, system isolation, SLDC, may conduct studies
again before clearance of the planned outage.(vii)SLDC is authorized to defer
the planned outage in case of any of the following:(a)Major Grid
disturbance.(b)System isolation.(c)Black out in a constituent system.(d)Any

## Chapter 8  
Scheduling and Despatch

### 8. Scheduling and Despatch.

(1)This chapter sets out the demarcation of responsibilities between various
entities and SLDC in scheduling and despatch of load in the Grid and procedure
for reactive power and voltage control mechanisms(2)Certain procedures are to
be adopted while scheduling of generation by State Sector Generating Stations
(SSGS), open access customers, share from central sector generation and other
licensees for scheduling the drawal by the beneficiaries of the State on a
daily basis. The procedure for submission of capability by each generating
company and submission of drawal schedule by each beneficiary / distribution
licensee of the State is intended to enable SLDC to prepare the generation and
drawal schedule connected with system operation. It also provides methodology
for issuing real time despatch / drawal instructions and rescheduling, if
required, along with the commercial arrangement for the deviations from
schedules.(3)The following specific points would be taken into consideration
while preparing and finalizing the schedules:(a)[ SLDC will issue despatch
instruction required to regulate all generation and imports from SSGS, IPPs,
CPPs and Generators based on renewable sources of energy according to the
hourly day ahead generation schedule, unless rescheduling is required due to
unforeseen circumstances. Genera tion from wind mills shall be scheduled as
per the Commission's Intra State Availability Based Tariff (ABT) order or
regulation in force.] [Substituted In/ Notification No. V1(2)/207/2013, dated
12.09.2013.](b)SLDC shall regulate the overall State generation in such a
manner that generation from following types of power stations where energy
potential, if unutilized, goes, as a waste shall not be curtailed.• Run of
river or canal based hydro stations.• Hydro-station where water level is at
peak reservoir level or expected to touch peak reservoir level (as per
inflows).• Wind Power Stations and Renewable Energy Sources.• Nuclear Power
Stations.(c)Despatch instructions shall be in Annexure format D1. These
instructions will recognize declared availability and other parameters that
have been made available by the generators to SLDC. These instructions shall
include time, power station, generating units, (total export in case of CPP)
and name of operators sending and receiving the same.(d)Standard despatch
instructions may include:• To switch a generator into or out of service.•
Details of reserve to be carried on a unit.• To increase or decrease MVAr
generation to assist with voltage profile as per unit capability at that time•
To begin pre-planned Black Start procedures.• To hold spinning reserve.• To
hold generating units on standby.• To control MW/MVAr drawal by beneficiaries
/ distribution licensees.(4)Demarcation of responsibilities:(i)The SLDC shall
have the total responsibility for:• [Scheduling or despatching the generation
of all agencies including the Utilities, IPPs, Generators based on renewable
sources of energy, Co-Generators, etc. connected to the Grid.] [Substituted by
Noti. No. V1(21/207/2013. dated 12.09.2013.]• Regulating the demand of the
beneficiaries / Distribution licensee in the State.• Regulating the drawal
from the central generating stations and regulating the bilateral
interchanges, if there is any.• Adopting merit order despatch, ABT procedures
and free governor operation at power stations wherever possible.(ii)SLDC shall
always endeavor to restrict its net drawal from central generating stations
and other generating stations within their respective drawal schedules and the
guidelines of ABT.(iii)The generating stations shall be responsible for power
generation generally according to the daily schedule provided to them by the
SLDC on the basis of the drawal schedules received from the beneficiaries /
distribution licensee and also in accordance with Merit Order Despatch and
Connectivity Agreements. However, the generating stations may deviate from the
given schedules depending on the plant and system conditions with the prior
approval from SLDC.Provided that when, the frequency is higher than 50.5 Hz,
the actual net injection shall not exceed the scheduled despatch for that
hour. Also while the frequency is above 50.5 Hz, the generating stations may
(at their discretion) back down without waiting for the advice from SLDC. When
the frequency falls below 49.5 Hz, the generation at all stations (except
those on peaking duty) shall be maximized, at least up to the level, which can
be sustained, without waiting for the advice from SLDC. Notwithstanding the
above, the SLDC may direct the generating stations / beneficiaries to increase
/ decrease their generation/ drawal in case of contingencies e.g. overloading
of lines / transformers, abnormal voltages, threat to system security. Such
directions shall immediately be acted upon.(iv)For all outages of generation
and transmission system, which may have an effect on the State Grid, all
entities shall co-operate with each other and co-ordinate their actions as per
the approved procedures separately. In particular, outages requiring
restriction of generation which a beneficiary / distribution licensee can
receive (and which may have a commercial implication) shall be planned
carefully to achieve the best optimization. The entities shall furnish to the
SLDC al81 requisite information for billing purposes.(v)All entities shall
abide by the concept of frequency linked load despatch and pricing of
deviations from schedule i.e. unscheduled interchanges. All generating units
of the entities and the licensees shall normally be operated according to the
standing frequency linked load despatch guidelines issued by the SLDC to the
extent possible, unless otherwise advised by the SLDC.(vi)The STU shall opt to
install special energy meters on all inter connections between the State
entities and other identified points for recording of actual net MWh
interchanges and MVArh drawals. The SLDC shall be responsible for computation
of actual net MWh injection of each generating stations and actual net drawal
of each beneficiary, 15 minute-wise, based on the above meter readings. The
SLDC shall be responsible for Intra-State Energy Accounting as per the scheme
approved by STU, and all entities shall extend the necessary assistance to the
STU personnel in timely collection of metered data. The generators shall
furnish the data as per Annexure D-2.(vii)The STU will undertake necessary

the generating stations in the States shall furnish to the SLDC, the station
wise ex-power plant MW and MWh capability foreseen for each time block of the
next day i.e. from 00.00 hours to 24.00 hours of the following day.(iv)The
SSLDC shall inform the SLDC the MW and MWh requirements for different hours
for the next day by 11.00 AM. The SLDC shall receive information from RLDC
regarding the MW and MWh entitlements from Central Generating stations for

information of the foreseen capabilities of the State generating stations
received from SSLDC and entitlements from CGS given by RLDC shall be compiled
by the SLDC everyday for the next day, and advised to all SSLDC by 12
AM.(vi)The SSLDCs shall review it vis-a-vis their foreseen load pattern based
on the drawal schedule of all the beneficiaries/ distribution licensees and
shall advise the SLDC by 1.00 PM, the sub station wise MW and MWh requirements
foreseen for different hours for the next day i.e., from 00.00 hours to 2400
hours of following day to the SLDC.(vii)The SLDC shall review the foreseen
load pattern and the generation capacity available including bilateral
exchanges if any, and advise the RLDC by 3.00 PM. their drawal schedule for
the next day for each of the generating stations in which they have shares and
the other generating companies in the State, their despatch schedule.(viii)By
5 PM each day, the RLDC shall convey the ex-power plant "despatch schedule" to
each of the Inter State Generating Stations, and "net drawal schedule" to each
SLDC / beneficiary in MW for different hours, for the next day.(ix)By 6 PM
each day, the SLDC shall convey the ex-power plant "despatch schedule" to each
of the State generating stations and "net drawal schedule" to each of the
State beneficiary / distribution licensee through SSLDC in MW for different
hours, for the next day.(x)The summation of the station-wise ex-power plant
generation schedules for all generating stations after deducting the
apportioned transmission losses (estimated), shall constitute the State
beneficiaries / distribution licensees drawal schedule(xi)While finalizing the
above daily generation schedules for the generating stations, the SLDC shall
ensure that the same 3je operationally reasonable, particularly in terms of
ramping-up /ramping-down rates and the ratio between minimum and maximum
generation levels. Additional charges payable to the generating companies on
account of such plant operations requiring oil support and / or unit shut-down
/ start-up shall also be considered by SLDC.(xii)The generating companies in
the State may inform through SSLDC any modification / changes to be made in
station wise drawal, schedule / foreseen capabilities, if any, to SLDC by 9.00
PM.(xiii)Based on the surplus, if any, the SLDC may arrange for bi-lateral

PM.(xiv)The SLDC shall receive the final 'drawal schedule' against Central
allocation along with bilateral exchange of power, if any by 11.00 PM.(xv)The
SLDC shall inform the final drawal schedule for the next day to SSLDC by 11.15
PM(xvi)The SSLDC shall, in turn, inform the beneficiaries / distribution
licensees the drawal schedule for the next day by 11.30 PM and it is
freezed.(xvii)In the event of any contingency, SLDC will revise the schedules
on the basis of revised declared capability by the generators. The revised
schedules will become effective from the 4th time block, counting the time
block in which the revision is advised by the generator to be the first one.
The revised declared capability will also become effective from the 4th time
block.(xviii)In the event of bottleneck in evacuation of power due to any
constraint, outage, failure or limitation in the transmission system,
associated switchyard and substations owned by STU (as certified by SLDC)
necessitating reduction in generation, SLDC will revise the schedules which
will become effective from the 4th time block, counting the time block in
which the bottleneck in evacuation of power has taken place to be the first
one. Also, during the first, second and third time blocks of such an event,
the scheduled generation of the station will be deemed to have been revised to
be equal, to actual generation and also the scheduled drawals of the
beneficiaries / distribution licensees will be deemed to have been revised to
be equal to their actual drawals.(xix)In case of any grid disturbance,
scheduled generation of all the generating stations and scheduled drawal of
all the beneficiaries / distribution licensees shall be deemed to have been
revised to be equal to their actual generation/drawal for all the time blocks
affected by the Grid Disturbance. Certification of Grid Disturbance and its
duration shall be done by SLDC.(xx)Revision of declared capability by
generator(s) and requisition by beneficiaries / distribution licensees for the
remaining period of the day will also be permitted with advance notice.
Revised schedules/declared capability in such cases shall become effective
from the 6th time block, counting the time block in which the request for
revision has been received in SLDC to be the first one.(xxi)If, at any point
of time, SLDC observes that there is need for revision of the schedules in the
interest of better system operation, it may do so on its own and in such
cases, the revised schedules shall become effective from the 4th time block,
counting the time block in which the revised schedule is issued by SLDC to be
the first one. To discourage frivolous revisions, SLDC may, at its sole
discretion, refuse to accept schedule/capability changes of less than 50
MW(xxii)Generation schedules and drawal schedules issued/revised by SLDC shall
become effective from designated time block irrespective of communication
success.(xxiii)For any revision of scheduled generation, including post facto
deemed revision, there shall be a corresponding revision of scheduled drawals
of the beneficiaries.(xxiv)While finalizing the drawal and despatch schedules
as above, the SLDC and SSLDCs shall also check that the resulting power flows
do not give rise to any transmission constraint. In case any impermissible
constraints are foreseen, the SLDC shall moderate the schedules to the
required extent, under intimation to the concerned Users. Any changes in the
scheduled quantum of power which are too fast or involve unacceptably large
steps, may be converted into suitable ramps by the SLDC.(xxv)On completion of
the operating day, by 24.00 hours, the schedule finally implemented during the
day (taking into account all before-the-fact changes) in despatch schedule of
generating stations and drawal schedule of the Users shall be issued by SLDC.
This schedule shall be the datum for commercial accounting. The average ex-bus
capability for each of the generating stations shall also be worked out based
on all before-the-fact advice to SLDC.(xxvi)The SLDC and the SSLDCs shall
properly document all the above information i.e. station-wise foreseen ex-
power plant capabilities advised by the generating stations, the drawal
schedule indented by the beneficiaries / distribution licensees, all schedules
issued by the SLDC / SSLDCs, and all revisions / updating of the
above.(xxvii)The procedure for scheduling carried out by SLDC/ SSLDCs, shall
be open to all entities for any checking / verification. In case any mistake /
omission is detected, the SLDC and SSLDCs shall forthwith make a complete
check and rectify the same.(xxviii)A procedure for recording the communication
regarding changes to schedules duly taking into account the time factor shall
be evolved by STU.(6)Reactive Power and Voltage Control(i)Regarding VAR drawal
/ absorption from Inter State Grid, the SLDC has to follow IEGC.(ii)All the
end users, distribution licensees, transmission licensees and STU are expected
to provide local VAR compensation such that they do not draw VARs from the ITV
Grid. VAR compensation has to commence in the following order.• Consumer end•
Distribution transformer end• At the substations end of 11 / 22 KV
distribution feeders• Substations• Generating stations(iii)While tap changing
on all 400 / 230 KV ICTs of CTU shall be done as per the instruction of RLDC,
tap changing of other ICTs shall be done as per the instructions of SLDC and
SSLDCs.(iv)The generating stations shall generate / absorb reactive power as
per instructions of SLDC, within the capability limits of the respective
generating units(v)Notwithstanding the above, SLDC may direct a beneficiary to
curtail its VAR drawal/injection in case the security of Grid or safety of any
equipment is endangered.(vi)In general, the beneficiaries shall endeavor to
minimize the VAR drawal at an interchange point when the voltage at that point
is below 95% of rated, and shall not return VARs when the voltage is above
105%.

## Chapter 9  
Commercial Issues and Implementation

### 9. Commercial Issues.

(1)In regard to central sector allocation of power, the CERC has full
jurisdiction to determine the tariff and other commercial issues.(2)Subject to
any scheme of tariff, as may be approved by the TNERC, the bulk power supply
agreements between the constituents shall duly specify the relationship
between capacity charges to be paid and plant availability, and energy charge
rates (in rupees per MWh) for each station, in ex-power plants. Regarding the
other commercial issues, the following are applicable:(i)The transmission
charges and other open access charges shall be paid to the respective
constituents as per the TNERC regulations issued time to time.(ii)The
summation of the station-wise ex-power plant drawal schedules for all
generating stations after deducting the apportioned transmission losses
(estimated), shall constitute the State beneficiaries / distribution licensees
drawal schedule which in turn shall be used for billing.(iii)In case of a
deviation from the generation schedule, the frequency-linked Unscheduled
Interchanges Charges (UI charges) shall be applicable for such deviations as
may be approved by the CERC/TNERC from time to time and dependent on average
frequency for the concerned 15-minute block.(iv)Energy Accounts shall be
prepared by the SLDC on a monthly basis. The beneficiaries / distribution
licensees as per provision in the respective PPAs shall pay these bills.(v)The
SLDC shall in parallel issue the weekly bills for UI charges and Reactive
Energy Charges to all constituents by Tuesday for the seven-day period ending
on the penultimate Sunday mid night. These bills shall have a higher priority,
and the generating stations and beneficiaries / distribution licensees shall
pay the billed amounts within 10 days of billing date.(vi)If payments against
the above bills are delayed beyond 10 days, the defaulting entities shall have
to pay a simple interest rate of 0.04 percent for each day of delay. The
interest so collected shall be paid to the entities who have to receive the
payment which got delayed.(vii)SLDC shall periodically review the actual
deviation from the-generation and net drawal schedules to check whether any of
the entities is indulging in unfair gaming. In case any such practice is
detected the matter shall be reported to the STU for further investigation /
action.(viii)All energy accounting calculation carried out by SLDC shall be
open to all users for any checking / verification. In case any mistake is
detected, the SLDC shall forthwith make a complete check and rectify the
mistake.(ix)Energy accounting (including billing of UI charges and reactiVe
energy charges) is one of the most important and critical function of SLDC.
Any flaw in the energy accounting will lead to serious financial consequences.
Hence, a committee to be designated by the Commission will conduct annual
audit on the accounting and technical performance of SLDC and present a report
to the Commission before the end of May every year for the previous financial
year.(x)Regarding VAR drawal / absorption from Inter State Grid, the SLDC has
to follow IEGC. The charge/payment for VARs, shall be at a nominal paise /
kVARh rate as may be approved by CERC / TNERC from time to time, and will be
between the beneficiary and the Pool Account and between two beneficiaries.
The generating stations shall generate / absorb reactive power as per
instructions of SLDC, within the capability limits of the respective
generating units. No payments shall be made to the generating companies for
such VAR generation / absorption.(xi)The basic rules for absorption /
generation are:• The Beneficiary pays for VAR drawal when voltage at the
metering point is below 97%.• The Beneficiary gets paid for VAR return when
voltage is below 97%.• The Beneficiary gets paid for VAR drawal when voltage
is above 103%.• The Beneficiary pays for VAR return wrhen voltage is above
103%.

## Chapter 10  
Non-Compliance

### 10. Non Compliance and Disputes.

(1)As stipulated under Section 33 (2), (4) and (5) of the Act, every licensee,
generating company, generating station, substation and any other person
connected with the operation of the power system shall comply with the
directions issued by SLDC. If any dispute arises with reference to the quality
of electricity or safe, secure and integrated operation of the State Grid or
in relation to any direction given by SLDC, it shall be referred to the
Commission for decision. Pending decision of the Commission the licensee or
the generating company shall comply with the directions of the SLDC. TNERC, in
turn, after due process, may order the defaulting entity for compliance,
failing which it may take penal action and other regulatory measures, which
includes termination of connectivity agreement/ de-linking from the Grid etc.,
through STU/SLDC.(2)Non-payment of dues: In case of non-payment of capacity
and energy charges, unscheduled interchange charges, transmission/SLDC
charges, etc. by any beneficiary, the affected generating company shall report
the matter to the STU. The latter shall verify and take up the defaulting
entity for paying up the dues. In case of inadequate response, the STU shall
report the same to TNERC. TNERC in turn, after due process, may order the
defaulting entity to pay the dues within a certain period, failing which the
TNERC may initiate necessary regulatory measures.
