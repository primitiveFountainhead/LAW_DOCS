Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution Ninth Amendment)
Bill, 1956 (Bill No. 29 of 1956) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION
(Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONSIn order to
implement the scheme of States reorganisation, it is necessary to make
numerous amendments in the Constitution with effect from the 1st October,
1956. This bill seeks to make these amendments and also some other amendments
to certain provisions of the Constitution relating to the High Courts and High
Court Judges, the executive power of the Union and the States, and a few
entries in the legislative lists. The reasons for making the amendments are
indicated below:-Clause 2.-The reorganisation scheme involves not only the
establishment of new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of the
existing States, but also the abolition of the three categories of States
(Part A, Part B and Part C States) and the classification of certain areas as
Union territories. Article 1 has to be suitably amended for this purpose and
the First Schedule completely revised.Clause 3.-The amendments proposed in
article 80 are formal and consequential. The territorial changes and the
formation of new states and Union territories as proposed in Part II of the
States Reorganisation Bill, 1956, involve a complete revision of the Fourth
Schdule to the Constitution by which the seats in the Council of States are
allocated to the existing States. The present allocation is made on the basis
of the population of each State as ascertained at the census of 1941 and the
number of seats allotted to each Part A and Part B State is according to the
formula, one seat per million for the first five millions and one seat for
every additional two millions or part thereof exceeding one million. It is
proposed to revise the allocation of seats on the basis of the latest census
figures, but according to the same formula as before.Clause 4.-The abolition
of Part C States as such and the establishment of Union territories make
extensive amendment of articles 81 and 82 inevitable. The provision in article
81(1)(b) that "the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial
constituencies" will no longer be appropriate, since after reorganisation each
of the States will be large enough to be divided into a number of
constituencies and will not permit of being grouped together with other States
for this purpose or being "formed" into a single territorial constituency.
Clause (2) of article 81 and article 82 will require to be combined and
revised in order to make suitable provision for Union territories. Instead of
amending the articles piecemeal, it is proposed to revise and simplify them.
Incidentally, it is proposed in clause (1)(b) of the revised article 81 to fix
a maximum for the total number of representatives that may be assigned to the
Union territories by Parliament.Clause 5.-The proposed revision of the proviso
to article 131 is consequential on the disappearance of Part B States as such.
The two parts of the existing proviso have been combined.Clause 6.-Article 153
provides that there shall be a Governor for each State. Since it may be
desirable in certain circumstances to appoint a Governor for two or more
States, it is proposed to add a proviso to this article to remove any possible
technical bar to such an appointment.Clause 7.-Sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of
article 168 provides for bi-cameral legislatures in certain States. It is
proposed that, among the reorganised States, Punjab and Mysore should continue
to have such a legislature, and that the enlarged Madhya Pradesh should also
be provided with one. Since the constitution of a Legislative Council for
Madhya Pradesh will necessarily take time, it is proposed to bring the
relevant amendment of article 168(1)(a) into force from a future date by means
of a public notification of the President.Clause 8.-This seeks to revise
article 170 mainly with a view to bringing it into line with articles 81 and
82 as revised by clause 4.Clause 9.-Under clause (1) of article 171, the
maximum strength of the Legislative Council of a State is fixed at one-fourth
of the strength of the Legislative Assembly of that State. Although in the
larger States, like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, this maximum is adequate, it
leads to difficulties in the case of the smaller States. It is, therefore,
proposed to alter the maximum to one-third of the strength of the Legislative
Assembly.Clause 10.-Article 216 empowers the President to appoint to a High
Court as many judges as he may from time to time deem it necessary and also to
fix the maximum number of judges for each High Court by a separate order. The
proviso is of little significance from the practical point of view, since the
order fixing the maximum may be changed by the President whenever necessary.
The appointment of additional and acting judges for which provision is sought
to be made in clause 14 will also involve either frequent modifications in the
order or a fixation of the maximum number at a high figure. It is, therefore,
proposed to omit the proviso to article 216.Clause 11.-The amendment of clause
(1) of article 217 proposed in this clause is consequential on the proposal to
provide for the appointment of additional and acting judges for limited
periods.Clause 12.-An important factor affecting the selection of High Court
judges from the bar is the total prohibition contained in article 220 on
practice after their retirement from the bench. It is proposed to revise the
article so as to relax this complete ban and permit a retired judge to
practise in the Supreme Court and in any High Court other than the one in the
which he was a permanent judge.Clause 13.-Article 222 empowers the President
to transfer judges from one High Court to another. Clause (2) of this article
goes on to provide that when a judge is so transferred he shall be entitled to
receive in addition to his salary a compensatory allowance. It is felt that
there is no real justification for granting such an allowance and it is
accordingly proposed to omit clause (2).Clause 14.-The provision in article
224 for recalling retired judges to function on the bench of a High Court for
short periods has been found to be neither adequate nor satisfactory. It is,
therefore, proposed to replace this article by a provision for the appointment
of additional judges to clear off arrears and for the appointment of acting
judges in temporary vacancies.Clause 15.-It is proposed to revise and simplify
articles 230, 231 and 232 having regard to the constitutional position of
States and Union territories after reorganisation. While under article 214
there will normally be a separate High Court for each State, power will be
required to establish common High Courts for two or more States. Power will
also be required to extend the jurisdiction of a High Court to a Union
territory, wherever necessary, and to exclude the jurisdiction of a High Court
from such territory. The revised articles 230 and 231 are designed to make
these provisions.Clause 16.-Part VIII of the Constitution provides for the
administration of Part C States and Part IX for the administration of Part D
territories. It is proposed to amend Part VIII to provide for the
administration of Union territories and to repeal Part IX.Clause 17.-While the
President is empowered by article 258 (1) to entrust Union functions to a
State Government or its officers, there is no corresponding provision enabling
the Governor of a State to entrust State functions to the Central Government
or its officers. This lacuna has been found to be of practical consequence in
connection with the execution of certain development projects in the States.
It is proposed to fill the lacuna by a new article 258A.Clause 18.-Article
VIII of the Covenant entered into by the Rulers of Travancore and Cochin in
May, 1949, for the formation of the United State of Travancore and Cochin
provided that Travancore's obligation to contribute annually a sum of Rs. 51
lakhs to the Travancore Devaswom Fund should continue as an obligation of the
United State. This arrangement was confirmed by article 238(10) (ii) of the
Constitution. It is proposed that the existing arrangement should be continued
even after the formation of the new State of Kerala , but the contribution to
the Travancore Devaswom Board from the Consolidated Fund of that State should,
in view of the transfer of territory from Travancore-Cochin to Madras, be
reduced from Rs. 51 lakhs to Rs. 46.5 lakhs.Clause 19.-In this clause it is
proposed to revise and amplify the scope of article 298, mainly to make it
clear that Union Government, as well as the State Governments, are competent
to carry on any commercial or industrial undertaking, whether or not it is
related to a matter within the legislative competence of the Union, or, as the
case may be, of the State. Similarly , the holding, acquisition and disposal
of property and the making of contracts by the Union or a State could be for
any purpose without constitutional impropriety. At the same time, the revised
article provides that this extended executive power of the Union and of the
States will be subject, in the former case, to legislation by the State, and
in the latter case, to legislation by Parliament.Clause 20.-The new article
350A proposed in this clause is designed to implement one of the States
Reorganisation Commission's important recommendations regarding safeguards for
linguistic minorities in the States after reorganisation.Clause 21.-It is
proposed to replace article 371 by another article making a special provision
with respect to the States of Andhra and Punjab. This article will enable the
President to constitute regional committees of the State Legislative Assembly
and secure their proper functioning by directing suitable modifications to be
made in the rules of business of Government and in the rules of procedure of
the Assembly.Clause 22.-The High Court of Travancore-Cochin will, as from the
appointed day, become the High Court for the new State of Kerala and the High
Courts of Mysore and Rajasthan will continue, respectively, as the High Courts
for the enlarged "new" States with the same names. Taking into account the
level of income at the bar and salaries payable to the judicial services in
these States, it is considered that there is no need to increase the salaries
payable to the Judges of these High Courts to the level of the other High
Courts. It is proposed to amend sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 10 of the
Second Schedule to the Constitution providing for a salary of Rs. 3,000 to the
Chief Justices, and Rs. 2,500 to the other Judges, of these three High Courts.
Sometimes it becomes necessary to appoint a retired district judge as a judge
of a High Court . In the absence of a legal provision for withholding the
pension due to such a judge, it has been the practise to obtain from him an
undertaking that he would not claim the pension for the period for which he
serves as a High Court judge. Since this is obviously unsatisfactory, it is
proposed to add a proviso to paragraph 10(1) of the Second Schedule on the
same lines as the proviso to paragraph 9(1) thereof regulating the salary of a
judge of the Supreme Court in similar circumstances.Sub-paragraphs (3) and (4)
of paragraph 10 are no longer required, since appropriate provision has been
made in the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Ace, 1954.Clause 23.-The
existence of three entries in the legislative lists (33 of List I, 36 of List
II and 42 of List III) relating to the essentially single subject of
acquisition and requisitioning of property by the Government gives rise to
unnecessary technical difficulties in legislation. In order to avoid these
difficulties and simplify the constitutional position, it is proposed to omit
the entries in the Union and State List and replace the entry in the
Concurrent List by a comprehensive entry covering the whole subject.Clause
24.-Entry 67 of the Union List refers to "ancient and historical monuments and
records, and archaeological sites and remains ,declared by Parliament by law
to be of national importance". A large number of ancient monuments,
archaeological sites, etc., have been declared to be of national importance by
an Act of Parliament. It requires another Act of Parliament to make the
slightest alteration in, or addition to, the lists in that Act, which seems to
be and unduly cumbrous procedure. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the
entry substituting for the words "declared by Parliament by law", the words
"declared by or under law made by Parliament". The same amendment is also
proposed to be made in the connected provisions, entry 12 of the State List,
entry 40 of the Concurrent List and article 49.Clause 25.-Although the Union
List has two entries 7 and 52, relating to industries, the latter alone is
referred to in entry 24 of List II. The omission of entry 7 of List I appears
to be due to an oversight and is sought to be rectified in this clause.Clause
26 and the Schedule.-These contain the consequential and minor amendments and
repeals proposed to be made in the Constitution and in the Constitution
(Removal of Difficulties) Order No. VIII pertaining to the Assam tribal
areas.An Act further to amend the Constitution of IndiaBe it enacted by
Parliament in the Seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows:-

1956, was enacted to make way for the States Reorganisation Act 1956. The
Act's provisions required changes to be made to various articles of the Indian
Constitution. It modified the articles in the First Schedule to establish new
boundaries for different states. The Fourth Schedule was also modified to
allocate seats in the Council of States to the existing states. Previously,
seats were allocated based on the formula of one seat per million for the
first five million, and one seat for every additional two million or part
thereof exceeding one million, according to the population of each state in
Part-A and Part-B. Additionally, changes were made to other provisions related
to the governor's powers and Legislative Councils in order to facilitate
proper governance of the new states. The main purpose of the Act was the
reorganization of states, and the other ancillary modifications were made to
support this objective. Also Refer ]
