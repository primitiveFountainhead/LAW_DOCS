The Tamil Nadu Co-Operative Societies Act, 1983Tamil Nadu Act 30 of
1983Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act,
1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983). - The Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act,
1961 (Tamil Nadu Act 53 of 1961) has been amended several times extensively,
among others, giving scope for enlargement of the electorate of the Board of
Directors of certain categories of co-operative societies, which bad proved
not conducive to proper functioning of the said societies Further, since the
year 1961 there has been vast progress in the so-operative movement calling
for suitable modification of the existing legislation to achieve the objects
of the aforesaid co-operative movement.2\. The Santhanam Committee on co-
operation the Administrative Reforms Commission on co-operation and the
Government of India guidelines on co-operative laws have made various
recommendations for improving the State co-operative laws.3\. Taking all these
into consideration and also some of the good features of the co-operative laws
of other States, it is proposed to bring in a comprehensive legislation to
repeal and re-enact the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 (Tamil
Nadu Act 53 1961) and the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Land Development Banks Act,
1934 (Tamil Nadu Act X of 1934) with suitable modifications.4\. The Bill seeks
to achieve the above objects.Published in Part IV-Section I of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 6th August 1980).Statement of
Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act, 1989
(Tamil Nadu Act 36 of 1989). - The Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1983
(Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983) and the rules made thereunder were brought into
force with effect from the 13th April 1988. The elections to cooperatives were
ordered to be held during 1988, but were subsequently put off in order to give
some more time to induct new members in the co-operatives.2\. When the
question of conducting elections to the co-operatives was taken up for
consideration, the Government felt that certain restrictive provisions in the
said Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983 may be removed before
conducting the elections, keeping in view the recommendations of the
Ardhanareeswaran Committee on Co-operative Law, the suggestions of the
Chairman, National Dairy Development Board and representations from other co-
operators.3\. The Government accordingly decided to amend the said Act for
removing those restrictive provisions The Government also decided to make
provision in the said Act for thirty per cent reservation for women and
eighteen per cent for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the board of
registered societies. In addition, it was also decided to amend certain other
provisions of the said Act for the smooth functioning of the co-operatives. To
give effect to the above decisions, the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1989 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 3 of 1989) was promulgated
by the Governor on the 1st July 1989 and the same was published in the Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 3rd July 1989.4\. The
Government have now decided to amend sections 33(12), 88 and 89 of the said
Act so as to provide for the appointment of an employee of any body corporate
owned or controlled by the Government as an administrator or, as the case
maybe, as a Special Officer to manage the affairs of a registered society.5\.
The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance and also to give effect to the
above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 1st November 1989.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act, 1992 (Tamil Nadu
Act 19 of 1992). - Section 33 of the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act,
1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983) provides for thirty per cent representation
for women and eighteen per cent representation for Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes in the boards of registered co-operative societies and for
nomination of the representatives, of women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes, if the representatives of women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes are not elected to that extent. In the election to the boards of
primary co-operative societies held under the Act, representatives of women
and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were not elected to the extent of
thirty per cent and eighteen per cent, respectively. Hence, a large number of
representatives of women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,
disproportionate to the elected members, were nominated, which resulted in an
abnormal tilt towards the nominated members. Such abnormal tilt towards
nominated members will not be conducive to the orderly development of co-
operative movement, but also be not in consonance with the principles of
democratic management of co-operatives. The Government have, therefore,
decided to amend the said Act providing for co-option by the elected members
of the board from among the members of the registered society, instead of
nomination.2\. It has also been decided to increase the strength of the board
of central and primary societies so that the representatives of women and
members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall not exceed fifty per
cent of the total strength of the board.3\. The Government have also decided
to amend the Act disqualifying a person who does not possess the
qualification, with reference to the principal object of the society,
prescribed in the rules or the by-laws, for admission as a member of the
society and for cessation of membership of such person.4\. In certain primary
societies to which elections were held in the year 1991 under the existing
provisions of the Act, the elected members of the board are continuing in
office. As the Government proposes to conduct elections to all societies in
accordance with the provisions of the Act, as now proposed to be amended, it
has been decided to supersede the boards of such societies.5\. This Bill seeks
to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 8th April
1992.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies
(Amendment) Act, 1999 (Tamil Nadu Act 50 of 1999). - The Government have
decided to amend the definition of "co-operative year" in respect of the
cooperative societies in the State in section 2(12) of the Tamil Nadu Co-
operative Societies Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983) to mean "the period
commencing on the 1st day of April of any year and ending with the 31st March
of the succeeding year" since the co-operative societies have switched over
their accounts from April to March.2\. Consequent on the orders issued in G.O.
Ms. No. 115, Co-operation, Food and Consumer Protection Department, dated 16th
February 1990 changing the nomenclature of the "Tamil Nadu Co-operative State
Land Development Bank Limited" and "Co-operative Primary Land Development
Bank" as the "Tamil Nadu Co-operative Slate Agriculture and Rural Development
Bank Limited" and the "Co-operative Primary Agriculture and Rural Development
Bank Limited" respectively, it has been decided to amend the said Act to be in
consonance with the orders issued in the aforesaid Government Order.3\. It has
been decided to prohibit the transfer of the property mortgaged to a Primary
Agriculture and Rural Development Bank except with the consent of the Bank in
writing and the sanction of the Registrar and subject to such terms and
conditions, as the Registrar may impose and also to provide punishment for
contravention of such prohibition. It has also been decided to provide
punishment for contravention of section 124 of the said Act.4\. The Bill seeks
to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 18th November
1999.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies
(Second Amendment) Act, 1999 (Tamil Nadu Act 51 of 1999). - Elections to most
of the primary co-operative societies were completed in October 1996 and the
elected members of the boards of primary co-operative societies have also
assumed office immediately. However, elections to a few primary co-operative
societies could not be conducted during 1996 due to stay granted by the High
Court and on certain administrative reasons. Elections were conducted for such
primary co-operative societies during the period 1997 and 1998.2\. The
elections to the Central and Apex Co-operative Societies which were managed by
the Special Officers for more than 22 years were held from July 1998 and the
elected members of board of such Central and Apex Co-operative Societies
assumed office on different dates commencing from August 1998.3\. As per
clause (a) of sub-section (10) of section 33 of the Tamil Nadu Co-operative
Societies Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983), the term of office of a
member who is elected to any board constituted under the Act shall be three
years.Hence, the term of office of the members of the boards of the primary
co-operative societies, who assumed office on the 1st day of November 1996
will come to an end on the 31st day of October 1999. But, the board members of
the Central and Apex Co-operative Societies who have been elected in the year
1998 and thereafter will continue for a longer period. With a view' to
enabling such members, who represent the primary co-operative societies in the
Central and Apex Co-operative Societies, to hold office for a term of three
years, the Government have decided to extend the term of office of the members
of the boards of primary co-operative societies, whoever effected during the
year 1996, 1997 and up to the 31st day of October 1998, till the 30th day of

ground of realities in a realistic manner.2\. Some of the registered co-
operative societies incur losses continuously and have a negative networth.
They are neither able to repay the Government dues nor the loans taken from
financing banks. The efforts to rehabilitate them have proved lo be futile.
With a view to clear their dues to the financing banks for which the
Government have stood guarantee and to recover the Government money invested
in these registered societies to the possible extent, at the earliest
opportunity, the Government of Tamil Nadu, after careful consideration, have
decided to empower the Registrar to lake any action including the direction to

Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983) the
Board of Directors of a registered society is vested with the power to admit
any individual eligible for admission, as a member of the society. At present
Special Officers are managing the affairs of the registered society. When the
Special Officers were empowered, by making specific provision in the said
Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983, to admit any individual eligible for admission, as
member of the Co-operative Society, the Full Bench of the High Court of Madras
in K. Nithyanandam v. State of Tamil Nadu and Others (2006 (1) L.W. 363)
declared the said provision as arbitrary, unreasonable, ultra vires and
unconstitutional, by observing as follows:-"In view of the above discussion,
this Court is of the view that the Co-operative Societies are constituted to
function through the democratic management by the General Body through its
elected board which alone is empowered to enroll the new Members".In view of
the above, new members could not be admitted in the Co-operative Societies for
the past 11 years.2\. Article 43-B and Part IX-B of the Constitution envisages
that the State shall endeavour and promote voluntary formation, autonomous
functioning, democratic control and professional management of Co-operative
Societies. In order to pave the way for democratic functioning of the Co-
operative Societies in tune with the provisions of the Constitution, the
Government have considered to admit new members in the Co-operative Societies
by empowering the General Body of the Co-operative Societies to admit, any
individual eligible for admission, as a member of the Society and have decided
to amend the said Tamil Nadu Act, 30 of 1983 suitably for the said purpose.
Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies (Third Amendment)
Ordinance, 2012 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 14 of 2012) was promulgated by the
Governor on the 3rd August 2012 and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 3rd August 2012.3\. The Bill seeks
to replace the said Ordinance.Published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 16th November, 2012.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies (Fourth Amendment) Act, 2012. - As per
Clause (2) of Article 243-ZK in Part IX-B of the Constitution of India, as
inserted by the Constitution (Ninety-seventh Amendment) Act, 2011, the
superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electrol roll
for, and the conduct of all elections to a co-operative society, shall vest in
such authority' or body, as may be provided by the Legislature of a State, by
Law.2\. The Government decided to constitute a separate Co-operative Societies
Election Commission to conduct free and fair elections to all Co-operative
Societies in this State, by amending the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies
Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983) suitably for this purpose. Accordingly,
the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies (Fourth Amendment) Ordinance, 2012
(Tamil Nadu Ordinance 17 of 2012) was promulgated by the Governor on the 6th
October 2012 and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette
Extraordinary, dated the 6th October 2012.3\. The Bill seeks to replace the
said Ordinance.Published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary,
dated 16th November, 2012.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu Co-
operative Societies (Fifth Amendment) Act, 2012. - Special Officers were
appointed under sub-section (1) of section 89 of the Tamil Nadu Co-operative
Societies Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1983) for a period of one year from
the 25th May 2001 in respect of Primary Co-operative Societies and from the
26th May 2001 in respect of Central And Apex Co-operative Societies. Since
elections to the said co-operative societies could not be conducted within the
above said period, the term of the Special Officers appointed under the said
section was last extended beyond the 24th May 2012 for a period of six months,
by amending the said Act. The period of their appointment is due to expire on
the 24th November 2012 in respect of Primary Co-operative Societies and on the
25th November 2012 in respect of Central and Apex Co-operative Societies.2\.
As per the schedule for conducting elections to the co-operative societies
approved by the Government, elections for the first two stages in the first
phase have been conducted on the 7lh July 2007 and on the 11th July 2007
respectively. During these polls, occurrences of certain incidents have been
brought to the notice of the Government. The Government are of the opinion
that these incidents have undermined the very purpose of conducting the
elections to the co-operative societies in the State. The Government have,
therefore, decided to cancel the elections to the cooperative societies
wherever they have been conducted and to hold fresh elections to all the co-
operative societies and have ordered accordingly. A new election schedule will
be announced by the Government for fresh elections in due course.3\. In view
of the above fact, elections to the Primary Co-operative Societies could not
be conducted on or before the 24th November 2012. Elections to the Central and
Apex Co-opera live Societies can be conducted only after the elected boards
are constituted in all the Primary Co-operative Societies. The Government
have, therefore, decided to extend the term of office of the Special Officers
of the said co-operative societies for a further period of two months and
twenty days beyond the 24th November 2012 in respect of Primary Co-operative
Societies and the 25th November 2012 in respect of Central and Apex Co-
operative Societies, by amending the said Act suitably for purpose.4\. The
