be caused if the submission of the full proof of the expenditure having been
incurred were insisted on, and he sees no reason to doubt that the payment has
actually been made.]

declined to accept commutation on the basis of an addition of year or years to
his actual age, may apply for a second medical examination at his own expense,
if at least one year has elapsed since his first medical examination. Such a
re-examination shall invariably be made by a medical board. If the re-
examination is carried out by a Service medical board, the Government share of
the fee, viz, rupees four shall be credited to the defence Services Estimates,
and the receipt together with the medical certificate shall be forwarded to
the Controller of Defence Accounts (Pensions).(3)If, in the opinion of the
medical authority, some special examination is necessary which it is not in a
position to carry out itself, it may, require the applicant to undergo such
examination at his own expense. No refund of such expenditure shall be given
by the Central Government irrespective of the result of examination.(4)In the
case of pensioners residing outside India the procedure shall be as laid down
in sub-regulation (3) of regulation 217.

### 231. Recovery of public claims from the commuted value.

\- Before the commuted value is paid, the Controller of Defence Accounts
(Pensions), shall ascertain whether any public claim is outstanding against
the applicant, and deduct the amount of such claim from the lump sum which
would but for the claim be payable to him. Where an over-payment is in the
process of recovery from the pension, the overpaid amount remaining unadjusted
at the time of commutation shall be recovered in one lump sum from the
commuted value payable.

### 232. Commutation of anticipatory or provisional pension.

\- An individual who applies for the commutation of a portion of his pension
and such portion is expressed as a percentage or fraction of the total pension
admissible to him and is allowed in the first instance to commute such
percentage or fraction of his anticipatory or provisional pension shall, in
the event of his final pension being more than his anticipatory or provisional
pension be allowed to commute a further sum without appearing before a fresh
medical board, so as to make the commuted amount equal to the specified
percentage or fraction of the amount of pension as finally sanctioned. In such
cases, commutation as finally sanctioned shall also take effect from the date
of the original commutation of the anticipatory or provisional pension and the
amount of residual pension shall also be re-adjusted from the same
date.]Appendix I[See Regulation 2(e)]

holding permanent commission who retires from service and becomes eligible for
a pension, shall have his pension assessed with reference to a standard rate
of retiring pension of Rupees Six hundred and twenty only per mensem for a
standard period of qualifying service for 24 years, provided-(a)he has held
the substantive rank of Lieut-Commander for at least two years more than the
minimum period of service required to be served in that substantive rank in
order to be eligible for promotion to the substantive rank of Commander under
the promotion rules in force at the time of his retirement.(b)[ He has been
found fit in all respects for promotion to the substantive rank of Commander
but has not been so promoted owing to insufficiency of vacancies in the
substantive cadre.] [Substoitued by S.R.O. 309, dated 5th September,
1974](c)he retires with the paid acting rank of Commander after holding that
rank for an aggregate period of not less than four years, of which not less
than three years shall be continuous.Explanation 1. - For purposes of clause
(a) the required period of service in the substantive rank of Lieut-Commander
will commence from the effective date from which substantive promotion to such
rank has been notified in the gazette.Explanation (2). - For purposes of
clause (c)-(i)an officer will be deemed to have retired with the paid acting
rank of Commander if his reversion to substantive rank immediately prior to
retirement is solely on account of the commencement of the furlough portion of
his leave pending retirement or his invalidation out of service.The period
subsequent to reversion to substantive rank will not, however, be taken into
account in reckoning the necessary service limits.(ii)Any paid acting rank
held by the officer higher than that of Commander will be equated to that paid

continuously in cases where an interruption of continuity is afterwards
cancelled by a retrospective restoration of the paid acting rank by competent
authority in accordance with the rules regulating retention of such rank.(2)An
officer who retires in the substantive rank of Commander but has held that
rank substantively for less than two years will also be eligible for the

under clause (c) of para 1 above, the period during which the officer held the
rank of Commander in a substantive capacity will also be taken into
account.(3)In all other respects, the pensionary entitlement of an officer to
whom this Appendix applies, will be regulated by these Regulations.Appendix
V(See Regulations 43, 101, 109)Nature, Assessment And Attributability Of
Disability And Entitlement To Disability PensionEntitlement Rules

### 1\. (a) The entitlement rules set out below apply in cases where the
disablement or death, on which the claim to casualty pensionary award is
based, takes place on or after the 1st April, 1948. These rules apply to all
personnel who are governed by these Regulations for the Indian Navy.

(b)These rules do not apply to an individual whose continuous service
commenced from a date prior to the 1st April, 1948, in so far as his
disablement or the cause of his death, can be regarded as attributable to or
aggravated by his service during the period 3rd September, 1939 to the 31st
March, 1948.

### 2\. Invalidment from service is a necessary condition for the grant of
disability pension. An individual who at the time of his release under the
Release Regulations is in a lower medical category than that in which he was
recruited will be treated as invalided from service. Sailors who are placed
permanently in a medical category other than 'A' and are discharged because no
alternative employment suitable to their low medical category can be provided
as well as those who having been retained in alternative employment but are
discharged before the completion of their engagement will be deemed to have
been invalided out of service.

### 3\. Disablement or death shall be accepted as due to naval service
provided it is certified that :- (a) the disablement is due to a wound, injury
or disease which-

(i)is attributable to Naval service;(ii)existed before or arose during naval
service and has been and remains aggravated thereby;(b)the death was due to or
hastened by :(i)a wound, injury or disease which was attributable to naval
service; or(ii)the aggravation by naval service of a wound, injury or disease
which existed before or arose during naval service.[Explanation. [Substitued
by S.R.O. 298, dated 16th November, 1966] \- This regulation also covers cases
of death after discharge or invaliding from service.][Note.-This rule also
covers cases of death after discharge/ invaliding from service.] [Inserted by
S.R.O. 309, dated 5th September, 1974]

### 4\. There must be a causal connection between disablement [or death]
[Inserted by S.R.O. 309, dated 5th September, 1974] and naval service for
attributability or aggravation to be conceded.

### 5\. In deciding on the issue of entitlement all the evidence, both direct
and circumstantial, will be taken into account and the benefit of reasonable
doubt will be given to the claimant. This benefit will be given more liberally
to the claimant in field service cases.

### 6\. Post-discharge claims - Cases in which a disease did not actually lead
to the member's discharge from service but arose within seven years
thereafter, may be recognised as attributable to service if it can be
established medically that the disability is a delayed manifestation of a
pathological process set in motion by service conditions obtaining prior to
discharge and that if the disability had been manifest at the time of
discharge the individual would have been invalided out of service on this
account. In cases where an individual in receipt of a disability pension dises
at home and it cannot, from a strictly medical point of view, be definitely
established that the death was solely due to the disablement in respect of
which the disability pension was granted-

(a)the benefit of the doubt in determining attributability would go to the
family of the deceased if death occurs within seven years from the date of his
invalidment from service, unless there are other factors adversely affecting
the claim; and(b)if death takes place more than seven years after the date of
man's invalidment from service, the benefit of doubt will go to the State.In
cases where an individual outlives a normal span of life, that is, where death
takes place at the age of sixty or above, the death should be held to be due
to normal causes and not to naval service.[Note. - Death of disability
pensioner whose disablement has been accepted on the basis of aggravation may
also be accepted as due to Naval service under Rule 3(b)(ii)above if the last
assessment of disablement was 50 percent or above. If the last accepted
assessment of disablement was less than 50 per cent, death should not be
regarded as due to service.The above procedure will apply when death is
established as due to the disability in respect of which disability pension
was granted. If this is not the case, the identification of the cause of death
with the invaliding disability will first be determined in accordance with the
provisions of this rule. If the identity can be conceded thereunder, the
procedure in the proceeding sub-paragraph will be followed for determining the
further point whether entitlement to special family pension can be conceded in
a case where an invaliding disability was aggravated by service.[Explanation.
[Inserted by S.R.O. 309, dated 5th September, 1974] \- Death of a disability
pensioner whose disablement has been accepted on the basis of aggravation may
also be accepted as due to naval service under paragraph 3(b) (ii) above if
the last assessment of disablement was 50 per cent or above. If the last
accepted assessment of disablement was less than 50 per cent, death should not
be regarded as due to service.]The above procedure will apply when death is
established as due to the disability in respect of which disability pension
was granted. if this is not the case, the identification of the cause of death
with the invaliding disability will first be determined in accordance with the
provisions of this paragraph. If the identity can be conceded thereunder, the
procedure in the preceding sub-paragraph will be followed for determining the
further point whether entitlement to special family pension can be conceded in
a case where an invaliding disability was aggravated by service.

### 7\. In respect of accidents the following rules will be observed :

(a)Injuries sustained when the man is on duty will be deemed to have arisen in
or resulted from Navy service unless they were self-inflicted or due to
serious negligence or misconduct in which cases the question of withholding
the pension in full/ in part will be considered.(b)A person subject to the
disciplinary Code of the Armed Forces is "on duty" during the period of time
when he is in the course of performance of an official task the failure to do
which would constitute an offence triable under the Disciplinary Code
applicable to him. The course of performance of a task includes the journey or
transport by a reasonable route from one's quarters to and back from the
appointed place of duty under organised arrangements.(c)A person is also
deemed to be "on duty" during the period of participation in recreation,
organised or permitted by Service authorities and of travelling in a body or
singly under organised arrangements. A person is also considered to be "on
duty" when proceeding to his leave station or returning from his leave station
at public expense.(d)An accident which occurs when a man is not strictly "on
duty" as defined may also be attributable to Service, provided that it is not
an accident which can be attributed to risk common to human existence in
modern conditions in India, unless such risk is definitely enhanced in kind or
degree by the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the person's
service. Thus, for instance, where a person is killed or injured by another
party by reason of belonging to the Armed Forces, he shall be deemed "on duty"
at the relevant time.This benefit will be given more liberally to the claimant
in cases occurring during the time when the person, subject to the Navy
Law.(i)is attached to, or forms part of a force which is engaged in operations
against an enemy, or(ii)is engaged in naval operations in, or is proceeding
to, the seas in the neighbourhood of a country or place wholly or partly
occupied by an enemy, or(iii)is attached to or forms part of a force which is
in military occupation of a foreign country.Explanation 1. - (a) Personnel of
thormed Forces participating in(i)local/national/international sports
tournaments as members of Service teams, or(ii)mountaineering expeditions
/gliding organised by the Service authorities, with the approval of Government
will be deemed to be "on duty" for purposes of these regulations;(b)personnel
of the Armed Forces participating in the above-mentioned sports tournaments or
in privately organised mountaineering expeditions or indulging in gliding as a
hobby, in their individual capacity, will not be deemed to be "on duty" for
purposes of these regulations, even though prior permission of the competent
Service authorities may have been obtained by them;(c)injuries sustained by
personnel of the Armed Forces in impromptu games and sports outside parade
hours, which are organised by, or with the approval of, the local Service
authority and death arising from such injuries, will continue to be regarded
as having occurred while "on duty" for purposes of these
regulations.Explanation 2. - The personnel of the Armed Forces deputed for
training at courses conducted by the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute,
Darjeeling, shall be treated on par with personnel attending other authorised
professional courses or exercises for the Defence Services for the purpose of
the grant of disability/ family pensions on account of disability/death
sustained during the courses.

### 8\. In respect of diseases, the following rules will be observed :

(a)Cases, in which it is established that conditions of naval service did not
determine or contribute to the onset of the disease but influenced the
subsequent course of the disease, will fall for acceptance on the basis of
aggravation.(b)A disease which has led to an individual's discharge or death
will ordinarily be deemed to have arisen in service if no note of it was made
at the time of the individual's acceptance for naval service. However, if
medical opinion holds, for reasons to be stated, that the disease could not
have been detected on medical examination prior to acceptance for service the
disease will not be deemed to have arisen during service.(c)If a disease is
accepted as having arisen in service, it must also be established that the
conditions of naval service determined or contributed to the onset of the
disease and that the conditions were due to the circumstances of duty in naval
service.(d)In considering whether a particular disease is due to naval
service, it is necessary to relate the established facts, in the aetiology of
the disease, and of its normal development, to the effect that conditions of
service, for example, exposure, stress, climate, etc., may have had on its
manifestation. Regard must also be had to the time factor. (Also see
classification of diseases at the end of this Appendix.)(i)Common diseases
known to be affected by exposure to weather. - Diseases such as Bronchitis,
Rheumatism and Nephritis indeed most diseases of the respiratory system,
joints and kidneys are affected by climatic conditions. The period and the
conditions of service at any particular place should be taken into account in
determining causal connection with service.(ii)Common diseases known to be
affected by stress and strain. - This should be decided with due reference to
the nature of the duties an individual has had to perform in naval service. It
may be that in some cases the individual had been engaged on sedentary duties
when they will normally not qualify.(iii)Diseases endemic to certain areas. -
Diseases such as Malaria, Kalazar, Filariasis, Dysentery, Cholera, etc., are
endemic in certain areas. These diseases may also be introduced by movements
of infected persons. In determining causal connection with service it will
have to be established that the conditions of naval service exposed the
individual to the infection as a result of which he contracted the disease.
Where there is medical evidence of the contraction of the diseases either
prior to entry into service, or while off duty or on leave or desertion or
unauthorised absence, etc., attributability should not be accepted unless the
disease occurs within the incubation period.(iv)Diseases due to infections in
service. - Entitlement to pension will be admitted if the exposure to
infection arose from the circumstances of the member's service.(v)Diseases
known to be affected by dietary compulsions. - The compulsions of service
would also cover such cases as gastric disorders, for example, gastritis,
gastric and duodenal ulcers, where it is established that the member was
unable to follow a dietary regime required for his condition. The effect of
service in such cases will be limited essentially to the question of
aggravation of a pre-existing constitutional condition. This will not normally
apply to individuals in sedentary occupation.(vi)Diseases which run their
course independently or external circumstances. - There are certain diseases
which would have run the same course whether the individual had been in the
Forces or not, for example, leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, etc. [see
classification of diseases, sub paragraph (E) at the end of this Appendix].
Such cases will not be accepted as aggravated by service unless it is clear
that owing to exigencies of service the man did not receive treatment of a
satisfactory character and standard or such treatment was so delayed as to be
less effective than it would have been.(1)Venereal disease will normally be
rejected but a sequela of the disease may sometimes be accepted as aggravated
by service. In the case of such disease contracted during service, grounds for
acceptance will rarely be found unless the member after treatment had returned
to full duty and had been subjected to such strain as would produce one of the
after effects of the disease sooner than would have normally been the case.
The strain must have been of an exceptional nature.(2)In the case of disease
contracted before service if the member had reached an age when such a
manifestation could be accepted, entitlement will not be conceded. On the
other hand, if the later manifestation had been produced or hastened by the
strain of service in which case there should be evidence that the strain was
of an exceptional nature, entitlement may be considered on the basis of
aggravation.(3)In the case of disease due to heredity, entitlement must be
determined as in para (2) above.(4)The above refers only to late
manifestations or sequela of venereal disease as Neuro-Syphilis or Cardio-
vascular Syphilis.(viii)Invalidation on account of indulgence in drugs or
drinks.-Entitlement shall not be conceded if the disability or death on which
the claim is based, resulted from indulgence in drugs or drinks which was
within one's own control.

### 9\. Unforeseen effects of service medical treatment.

(a)Where unforeseen complications arise as a result of treatment (including
operative treatment) given for the purpose of rendering a member fit for
service duties, any disablement resulting will normally be accepted as
attributable to service.(b)Where the treatment is given for other reasons, the
position regarding any unforeseen complications differs according as the
condition which necessitated treatment was or was not, either attributable to
or aggravated by service. If it was so attributable or aggravated, any
disablement resulting from the treatment will normally be accepted as
attributable to service. if it was not, no responsibility will be accepted for
the additional disablement unless neglect, delay, faulty technique or lack of
reasonable skill can be held responsible for the untoward out come, or the
exigencies of service before, during or after the treatment can be held to
have caused or aggravated the condition.(c)The above considerations apply
whether the treatment is given in a service hospital or under service
arrangements in any other hospital but will not apply if the treatment is
undertaken under private arrangement by an individual.

### 10\. Assessment.

(a)The assessment of a disability is the estimate of the degree of disablement
it causes, which can properly be ascribed to service as defined below.(b)The
disablement properly referable to service will be assessed as under:(i)At the
time of discharge from the forces.-Normally the whole of the disablement then
caused by the disability. This rule will apply irrespective of whether the
disability is actually attributable to service, or is merely aggravated
thereby. In the latter event, part of the disablement on discharge may have
been present before service and/or may have been brought about by the natural
progress of the disability during service. But as it is impossible, for so
long as the strain and stress of service continues, to apportion
quantitatively the effects of service and non-service factors, the entire
disablement at the time of discharge will be taken into account. For example
:(1)Where a person who had a partially disabled hand sustains injury to the
same hand which renders it less useful than before or a person with an
impaired foot injures the other as a result of service thus increasing his
defect in locomotion, or(2)Where a person gives history of cough and cold
prior to enrolment and is invalided out of service for Chronic Bronchitis held
to be aggravated by service, pension will be admissible for the total
disablement.(ii)On resurvey of disability after discharge from the service. -
The whole of the disablement then caused by the disability, less the
following:(1)The part due to non-service factors, such as individual habits,
occupation in civil life, accident after discharge, climate environment after
discharge.(2)Any worsening due to the natural progress of the disability since
discharge apart from the effects of service.Deduction (1) will be made in all
cases; while deduction (2) above will apply only in cases where the disability
is accepted as aggravated by, but not attributable to service. (c) In cases
accepted as aggravated by service, although a percentage of disablement, equal
to more than twenty per cent may be assessed on medical resurvey, after
discharge from service, in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(ii)(2) above,
disability pension will cease to be payable as soon as the effects of the
aggravation by service have passed away, for example, where a person with
disease, for example, Fibrositis, Bronchitis, Eczema, etc., held to be
aggravated by service is invalided out and on resurvey is found by the Medical
Board to have been restored (a) to his pre-service condition or (b) the
condition in which he may have been normally at that time even if he had not
joined the forces, aggravation by service will be deemed to have passed
away.(d)[ Paired Organs-(i)Paired organs, namely eyes, ears, arms and legs
shall be considered together, where disablement due to service occurs in one
of a pair of organs, assessment on discharge will be made with reference to
the diminution of the functional capacity of the organs working together.
Therefore, assessment will include functional defect of the pair of
organs.(ii)Subject to the exceptions specified below, any subsequent increase
in the non-service disablement and non-service disablement arising after
discharge whether due to injury or disease will be excluded from the
assessment.(iii)Cases arise in which at the time of discharge there is damage
by service to only one of the paired organs namely eyes, ears, arms (including
hands) and legs (including feet) and the other is, either normal or impaired
in a minor degree. Where the disablement acceptable under clause (ii) and the
disablement of the other limb or organ are together assessable at any
subsequent date at 100 per cent, the assessment for pension purposes will be
increased by one half of the difference between the current assessment and 100
per cent. For instance a pensioner receiving an award at 40 per cent rate for
the loss of an eye who later loses the sight of his other eye through a non-
service cause, will have his award increased to 70 per cent rate; and a
pensioner with an award at 80 per cent for a gunshot found of an arm who later
develops severe arthritis of his other arm, thereby being 100 per cent
disabled, will qualify for a revised award at 90 per cent rate. Where the
combined disablement of the pair of organs is less than 100 per cent, but is
more than twice as serious as the disablement acceptable under clause (ii),
the assessment will be increased to one half of the combined disablement. if,
for example, a pensioner with an award at 30 per cent rate for the loss of
vision of one eye partially loses the sight of the other eye through a non-
service cause the defective vision of both eyes together is assessable at 80
per cent, his award will be increased to 40 per cent rate.(iv)The provisions
of the preceding clause are applicable even where the second of a pair of
organs has been disabled by some generalised disability (e.g. rheumate
arthritis) which would have also disabled the first of the pair if it had not
been lost or damaged as the result of service.](e)Composite assessments. -
Where there are two or more disabilities due to service, compensation will be
based on the composite assessment of the degree of disablement. Generally
speaking, when separate disabilities have entirely different functional
effects, the composite assessment will be the arithmetical sum of their
separate assessments. But where the functional effects of the disabilities
overlap, the composite assessment will be reduced in proportion to the degree
of overlapping.(f)Nil disablement. - Where although a definite disability is
or has been in evidence, the Medical Board consider that any disablement
resulting therefrom has ceased or has become so small as not to admit of
assessable compensation, the assessment will be expressed as "nil
disablement".(g)Where the disability due to service has no connection with the
pre-existing disability, as for example, a person who had lost a finger prior
to enlistment, loses a great toe by service, compensation will be restricted
to the loss of the great toe only.Classification of Diseases referred to in

individual's refusal to undergo medical treatment or an operation for his
disability attributable to or aggravated by military service, is reasonable or
unreasonable.

### 1\. Refusal to undergo medical treatment or an operation shall be held to
be reasonable:

(a)when, in the opinion of the medical authorities, it is improbable that such
treatment or operation would cure the disability or reduce its percentage or
where such treatment or operation may be severe and dangerous to life;
or,(b)when, in the opinion of the Commanding Officer, Ship/ Establishment to
undergo the operation or the treatment prescribed, is opposed to religious or
caste prejudices of a valid nature and the refusal is the bona fide outcome of
such prejudices.

### 2\. Refusal to undergo medical treatment or an operation shall be held to
be unreasonable:

(a)when, in the opinion of the medical authorities, it is due to malingering;
or,(b)when, in the opinion of the Commanding Officer, Ship/Establishment, it
is due to a desire to avoid further service or to obtain or retain a pension
or to receive an enhanced pension.

### 3\. If in the opinion of the Commanding Officer, Ship/Establishment, the
individual, has grounds not covered by the above paragraphs for refusing
medical or.

which aggravated the disability.(ii)Whether the effects of such aggravation
still persist.(iii)If the answer to (ii) is in the affirmative, whether effect
of aggravation will persist for a material period.(d)in the case of a
disability under C, the board should state what exactly in their opinion is
the cause thereof.Confidential

### 3\. (a) Was the disability attributable to the individual's own negligence
or mis-conduct? If so, in what way?

individual refused to undergo operation/treatment? If so, individual's reasons
will be recorded.Note.-In case of refusal of operation/treatment a certificate
from the individual will be attached.(d)Has the effect of refusal been
explained to and fully understood by him/her, viz., a reduction in, or the
entire withholding of, any disability pension to which he/she might otherwise
be entitled?(e)Do the medical board consider it probable that the
operation/treatment would have cured the disability or reduced its
percentage?(f)If the reply to (e) is in affirmative, what is the probable
percentage to which the disablement could be reduced by
operation/treatment?(g)Do the medical board consider the operation to be
severe and dangerous to life?(h)Do the medical board consider the individual's
refusal to submit to operation/treatment reasonable? Give reasons in support
of the opinion, specifying the operation/treatment recommended.

### 4\. What is present degree of disablement as compared with a healthy
person of the same age and sex? Percentage will be expressed as Nil or as
follows-

(1.5%, 6-10%,11-14%,15-19% and thereafter in multiples of ten from 20 per cent
to 100 per cent).

Special Instructions With Regard To Evidence In Cases Of Self Inflicted Wounds

### 10\. In these cases the statement mentioned in Instructions No. 6 and 7
above should bring out all material points, e.g., statements to the effect
that the witness was with the accused standing on the fire step (or sitting in
a dug-out). That the accused was cleaning his rifle, position of safety catch,
magazine, etc., if known, muzzle of rifle, on toe of foot and hand on muzzle;
that accused pulled trigger; that the rifle was afterwards examined and an
empty cartridge case was found in the chamber; that accused was seen to be
wounded; that accused said, e.g., "I have shot myself", "I did not know it was
loaded", etc.

### 11\. An officer or sailor is specially trained in the safe use of his
rifle and revolver, an evidence of any neglect of the ordinary precautions as
to their handling in such cases usually has considerable bearing on the
question of negligence. In cases of wilful self-wounding the fullest possible
evidence inconclusive, this charge should not be used. The charge in respect
of personnel subject to the Navy Act will, therefore, usually be laid under
Navy Act Section 61(a) and an alternative charge to this effect should be made
even if the accused is to be tried under Navy Act section 61(a) for wilful
maiming.

[In case of disabilities due to accidents, the Commanding Officer should
certify here (a) Whether the disability was sustained, according to the
information available, while the individual affected was in the actual
performance of Naval duty and, if so, what was the nature of such duty, and
(b) whether, in his opinion, the disability was attributable to service in the
Indian Navy/field service; and he should state the reasons underlying his
opinion as regards attributability. In cases of accidents attributable to
negligence on the part of the individual concerned, the provisions of
Regulation 102 will apply.]I certify that the particulars given are correct as

.........................Recommended.Station ....:...................Date
..............................Captain Naval Barracks.InstructionsThis form
will not be used for the reassessment of degrees of disability under
Regulations 110 and 111.

### 1\. Two copies of this form for each man (with his medical history sheet
and service book/ certificate of service/agreement-T-124-India) will be
submitted by the applicant's Commanding Officer to the Staff Officer of the
station of assembly of Board, for transmission to the Medical Board. in the
event of further boards being held for reassessment of disability or for any
other purpose the previous board proceedings will be laid before those boards.

### 2\. When a Medical Board (with the exception of a board for reassessment
of disability) is about to be held on a sailor the Commanding Officer of the
hospital concerned will apply, in writing, to the Commanding Officer of the
person about to be brought before the board of his opinion, expressed in
writing in duplicate, whether or not the wound, injury, or disease from which
the individual is suffering is due to field service or to service in the
Indian Navy in ordinary peace conditions. When recording his opinion the
Commanding Officer of the person concerned will include therein a short
statement of the reasons which have led him to form his conclusions in the
matter. The Medical Officer who prepares the statement of the case will attach
thereto the written opinion of the Commanding Officer obtained in the manner
described above.

Claims to disability pension on account of disease should invariably be
accompanied by Form 9 (I.A.EM.1231) duly completed in all respects, vide
instructions printed on the reverse of the form.

### 3\. The board, after verifying the identification marks of the individual
and having considered the testimony of the Officer Commanding ship
/establishment and the medical history of the case, will state from what
disease, injury, or wound, if any, the individual is suffering and will record
their further opinion under one of the following heads:

(a)Fit for further service.(b)Recommended for further treatment or
observation.(c)Recommended for sick leave, stating period.(d)Unit for further
service.In all cases, except when the board finds that the individual is
suffering from no appreciable disability, the board will submit replies to
questions (2), (3, (4) if applicable (5), (6) and (7) on page 275.

### 4\. Cases of men who have brought disease on themselves or who have
aggravated or retarded the cure of their disability in the hope of obtaining a
pension or gratuity, will be reported for the orders of the Captain Naval
Barracks, Bombay, if the board are fully satisfied as to the facts. Captain
Naval Barracks, Bombay after considering the advice of Principal Medical
Officer, Indian Navy, will decide whether an individual is guilty of
aggravating or retarding the cure of his disability. Refusal of operation
should not be considered as retarding the cure of a disability and cases of
this nature should be dealt with in the manner prescribed in Regulation 104.

### 5\. Claims to disability pension on account of wound or injury received
accidentally should invariably be accompanied by the proceedings of the Board
of Enquiry where required. These will be scrutinised by the Medical Officer
who prepares the statement of case on page 274 an by the Medical Board and
sent along with the Roll to the Controller of Defence Accounts (Pensions),
Allahabad through Captain Naval Barracks, Bombay. In such cases the Medical
Board will assess the percentage of the disability but will not express an
opinion as regards the attributability or otherwise except on purely medical
grounds. As regards accidents, attributable to negligence on the part of the
individual concerned the case should be submitted to the Central Government
for orders.

### 6\. When an individual has been examined by a Medical Board with a view to
determining his claim to the grant of or continuance of a disability pension
the authority arranging for his appearance before the board will inform him,
after consultation with the Controller of Defence Accounts (Pensions) whether
on the finding of the Board he is eligible or not for the grant or continuance
of such a pension. The proceedings of such a Medical Board are confidential.
The person concerned should not be informed of the percentage degree of his
disability but he should be informed as to the nature of his disability for
which he is invalided.

Thumb and finger impressions

### 7\. Thumb and finger impressions to be taken on page 272 by the Commanding
Officer of the ship or establishment.

A small quantity of printer's ink should be well rubbed on a tin slab until a
very thin, even layer is formed. The balls of the thumb and of all the fingers
of the left hand of the individual, after being wiped, should be laid on the
inked slab and rolled from side to side (not rubbed) until sufficiently inked
(this can be learnt from experience) and then lightly and carefully rolled on
the paper on which the print is to be taken in such a way that the pattern of
the whole of the thumb and fingers from side to side is clearly impressed on
it. It must be specially borne in mind that any side movement either at the
time of applying or removing the thumb on fingers will cause a smudge and
spoil the impression.The impressions are required for permanent record in the
audit office.Sailors are permitted to complete the page 272 and 277 with three
specimen signatures instead of affixing their thumb and finger
impressions.Statement Of CaseThe Medical Officer in charge of the case will
enter below a statement of the circumstances, as far as can be ascertained, in
which the wound injury or disease originated, the present condition of the
disability, his opinion as to the fitness or otherwise of the individual for
further service together with any further information likely to assist the
Board in forming opinions on the questions before them.N.B. - Before
completing the statement the medical officer will read carefully the
instructions in paragraphs on pages 273 and 274 of this form.Station

part of pension that may be commuted. I hereby acknowledge that in accepting
the advance, I fully understand that the capitalised value now paid to me is
subject to revision on the completion of the necessary formal enquiries and I
promise to have no objection to such revision on the ground that the
