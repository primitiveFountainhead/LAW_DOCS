## Chapter V  
Investigation Of Charges And Trial By Court-Martial

Section 1-investigation Of Charges And Remand For TrialPower of commanding
officers

### 22. [ Hearing of charge

.-(1) Every charge against a person subject to the Act shall be heard by the
commanding officer in the presence of the accused. The accused shall have full
liberty to cross-examine any witness against him, and to call such witness and
make such statement as may be necessary for his defence:Provided that where
the charge against the accused arises as a result of investigation by a Court
of inquiry, wherein the provisions of rule 180 have been complied with in
respect of that accused, the commanding officer may dispense with the
procedure in sub-rule (1).(2)The commanding officer shall dismiss a charge
brought before him if, in his opinion the evidence does not show that an
offence under the Act has been committed, and may do so if, he is satisfied
that the charge ought not to be proceeded with:Provided that the commanding
officer shall not dismiss a charge which he is debarred to try under sub-
section (2) of section 120 without reference to superior authority as
specified therein.(3)After compliance of sub-rule (1), if the commanding
officer is of opinion that the charge ought to be proceeded with, he shall
within a reasonable time-(a)dispose of the case under section 80 in accordance
with the manner and form in Appendix III; or(b)refer the case to the proper
superior military authority; or(c)adjourn the case for the purpose of having
the evidence reduced to writing; or(d)if the accused is below the rank of
warrant officer, order his trial by a summary Court-Martial:Provided that the
commanding officer shall not order trial by a summary Court-Martial without a
reference to the officer empowered to convene a district Court-Martial or on
active service a summary general Court-Martial for the trial of the alleged
offender unless-(a)the offence is one which he can try by a summary Court-
Martial without any reference to that officer; or(b)he considers that there is
grave reason for immediate action and such reference cannot be made without
detriment to discipline.(4)Where the evidence taken in accordance with sub-
rule (3) of this rule discloses an offence other than the offence which was
the subject of the investigation, the commanding officer may frame suitable
charge(s) on the basis of the evidence so taken as well as the investigation
of the original charge.]

### 23. Procedure for taking down the summary of evidence .-(1) Where the case
is adjourned for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to waiting, at the
adjourned hearing evidence of the witnesses who were present and gave evidence
before the commanding officer, whether against or for the accused, and of any
other person whose evidence appears to be relevant, shall be taken down in
writing in the presence and hearing of the accused before the commanding
officer or such officer as he directs.

(2)The accused may put in cross-examination such questions as he thinks fit to
any witness, and the questions together with the answers thereto shall be
added to the evidence recorded.(3)The evidence of each witness after it has
been recorded as provided in the rule when taken down, shall be read over to
him, and shall be signed by him, or if he cannot write his name shall be
attested by his mark and witnessed as a token of the correctness of the
evidence recorded. After all the evidence against the accused has been
recorded, the accused will be asked: "Do you wish to make any statement? You
are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say
will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence." Any statement
thereupon made by the accused shall be taken down and read to him, but he will
not be cross-examined upon it. The accused may then call his witnesses,
including, if he so desires, any witnesses as to character.(4)The evidence of
the witness and the statement (if any) of the accused shall be recorded in the
English language. If the witness or accused, as the case may be, does not
understand the English language, the evidence or statement, as recorded, shall
be interpreted to him in a language which he understands.(5)If a person cannot
be compelled to attend as a witness, or if owing to the exigencies of service
or any other grounds (including the expense and loss of time involved), the
attendance of any witness cannot in the opinion of the officer taking the
summary (to be certified by him in writing), be readily procured, a written
statement of his evidence purporting to be signed by him may be read to the
accused and included in the summary of evidence.(6)Any witness who is not
subject to military law may be summoned to attend by order under the hand of
the commanding officer of the accused. The summon shall be in the form
provided in Appendix III.

### 24. Remand of accused .-(1) The evidence and statement (if any) taken down
in writing in pursuance of rule 23 (hereinafter referred to as the "summary of
evidence"), shall be considered by the commanding officer, who thereupon shall
either-

(a)remand the accused for trial by a Court-Martial; or(b)refer the case to the
proper superior military authority; or(c)if he thinks it desirable, re-hear
the case and either dismiss the charge or dispose of it summarily.(2)If the
accused is remanded for trial by a Court-Martial, the commanding officer shall
without unnecessary delay either assembly a summary Court-Martial (after
referring to the officer empowered to convene a district Court-Martial when
such reference is necessary) or apply to the proper military authority to
convene a Court-Martial, as the case may require.[* * *]

### 26. Summary disposal of charges against officer, junior commissioned
officer or warrant officer .-(1) Where an officer, a junior commissioned
officer or a warrant officer is remanded for the disposal of a charge against
him by an authority empowered under section 83, 84 or 85 to deal summarily
with that charge, the summary of evidence [* * *] shall be delivered to him,
free of charge, with a copy of the charge as soon as practicable after its
preparation and in any case not less than twenty four hours before the
disposal.

(2)Where the authority empowered under section 83, 84 or 85, decides to deal
summarily with a charge against an officer, junior commissioned officer or
warrant officer, he shall unless he dismisses the charge, or unless the
accused has consented in writing to dispense with the attendance of the
witnesses, hear the evidence in the presence of the accused. The accused shall
have full liberty to cross-examine any witness against him, and to call any
witness and make a statement in his defence.(3)The proceedings shall be
recorded as far as practicable in accordance with the form in Appendix IV and
in every case in which punishment is awarded, the proceedings together with
the conduct sheet, summary [* * *] [Certain words omitted by S.R.O. 17(E),
dated 6.12.1993. ] of evidence and written consent to dispense with the
attendance of witnesses (if any) of the accused, shall be forwarded through
the proper channel to the superior military authority as defined in section
88.

### 27. Delay reports .-(1) In every case where a person subject to the Act,
who is not on active service, is in military custody for a period longer than
eight days without a Court-Martial for his trial having been ordered to
assemble, or without a punishment having been awarded to him under section 80,
the commanding officer shall make a report in the form specified in Appendix
III to the officer empowered to convene a general or a district Court-Martial
for the trial of such person. Such report shall be made to the authority
mentioned in this rule at intervals of every eight days until a Court-Martial
is ordered to assemble, or a punishment is awarded under section 80, or such
person is released from custody, as the case may be.

(2)A copy of every such report made on or after the forty-eighth day of such
custody shall be sent by the commanding officer direct to the Deputy Judge-
Advocate-General of the command in which such person is held in
custody.(3)(i)Detention in military custody beyond two months of a person
subject to the Act, who is not on active service and in whose case a Court-
Martial for a trial has not been ordered to assemble, shall require the
sanction of the Chief of the Army Staff, or any officer authorised by him in
this behalf with the approval of the Central Government, who may sanction
further detention for a specified period, which he may extend from time to
time, subject to a total period of detention of three months.(ii)Any such
detention beyond a period of three months shall require the approval of the
Central Government.Framing charges

### 28. Charge-sheet and charge .-(1) A charge-sheet shall contain the whole
issue or issues to be tried by a Court-Martial at one time.

(2)A charge means an accusation contained in a charge-sheet that a person
subject to the Act has been guilty of an offence.(3)A charge-sheet may contain
one charge or several charges.

### 29. Commencement of charge-sheet .-Every charge-sheet shall begin with the
name and description of the person charged and state his number, rank, name
and the corps or department (if any) to which he belongs. When the accused
person does not belong to the regular Army, the charge-sheet shall show by the
description of him, or directly by an express averment, that he is subject to
the Act in respect of the offence charged.

### 30. Contents of charge .-(1) Each charge shall state one offence only and
in no case shall an offence be described in the alternative in the same
charge.

(2)Each charge shall be divided into two parts-(a)statement of the offence;
and(b)statement of the particulars of the act, neglect or omission
constituting the offence.(3)The offence shall be stated, if not a civil
offence, as nearly as practicable in the words of the Act, and if a civil
offence, in such words as sufficiently describe in technical words.(4)The
particulars shall state such circumstances respecting the alleged offence as
will enable the accused to know what act, neglect or omission is intended to
be proved against him as constituting the offence.(5)The particulars in one
charge may be framed wholly or partly by a reference to the particulars in
another charge, and in that case so much of the latter particulars as are so
referred to, shall be deemed to form part of the first mentioned charge as
well as of the other charge.(6)Where it is intended to prove any facts in
respect of which any deduction from pay and allowances can be awarded as a
consequence of the offence charged, the particulars shall state those facts
and the sum of the loss or damage it is intended to charge.

### 31. Signature on charge-sheet .-The charge-sheet shall be signed by the
commanding officer of the accused and shall contain the place and date of such
signature.

### 32. Validity of charge-sheet .-(1) A charge-sheet shall not be invalid
merely by reason of the fact that it contains any mistake in the name or
description of the person charged, provided that he does not object to the
charge-sheet during the trial, and that no substantial injustice has been done
to the person charged.

(2)In the construction of a charge-sheet or charge, there shall be presumed in
favour of supporting the same every proposition which may reasonably be
presumed to be impliedly included though not expressed therein.Preparation for
defence by accused person

### 33. Right of accused to prepare defence .-(1) Correspondence between the
accused and his legal advisers shall not be liable to be censored. The accused
shall inform his commanding officer of the names of such advisers and shall
also inform him of any distinctive marks that such correspondence will bear.

(2)An accused person shall have the right to interview any witness whom he may
wish to call in his defence. The provisions of rule 137 shall apply to
procuring the attendance of such witnesses.(3)If the accused so desires, the
commanding officer of the accused shall take such steps as the circumstances
of the case permit to obtain a written statement from a witness whom the
accused may wish to call in his defence. The statement shall be obtained in a
closed envelope which shall be given to the accused person unopened.(4)If the
accused person gives to his commanding officer the name of any person whom he
wishes to call in his defence, no person shall interview such witness with
reference to the charges against the accused except in the presence of the
accused, unless the accused agrees to dispense with his presence in writing.
Similarly if the accused wishes to interview a witness whom the prosecutor
intends to call, the interview shall be in the presence of an officer detailed
by the commanding officer of the accused person.(5)The commanding officer of
the accused person or the officer responsible for his custody shall take
adequate precautions so that no conversation which the accused person may have
with his legal advisers or witnesses is liable to be overheard.(6)The accused
person shall have the right to address an application to the Deputy or
Assistant Judge-Advocate-General of the command within which he for the time
being is, if he is kept under arrest longer than forty-eight days without
being brought to trial or is not given full liberty for preparing his
defence.(7)As soon as practicable after an accused has been remanded for trial
by a general or district Court-Martial, and in any case not less than ninety-
six hours or on active service twenty-four hours before his trial, an officer
shall give to him free of charge a copy of the summary of evidence, [* * *] an
abstract of the evidence, and explain to him his rights under these rules as
to preparing his defence and being assisted or represented at the trial, and
shall ask him to state in writing whether or not he wishes to have an officer
assigned by the convening officer to represent him at the trial, if a suitable
officer should be available. The convening officer shall be informed whether
or not the accused so elects.

### 34. Warning of accused for trial .-(1) The accused before he is arraigned
shall be informed by an officer of every charge for which he is to be tried
and also that, on his giving the names of witnesses or whom he desired to call
in his defence, reasonable steps will be taken for procuring their attendance,
and those steps shall be taken accordingly.

The interval between his being so informed and his arraignment shall not be
less than ninety-six hours or where the accused person is on active service
less than twenty-four hours.(2)The officer at the time of so informing the
accused shall give him a copy of the charge-sheet and shall, if necessary,
read and explain to him the charges brought against him. If the accused
desired to have it in a language which he understands, a translation thereof
shall also be given to him.(3)The officer shall also deliver to the accused a
list of the names, rank and corps (if any), of the officers who are to form
the Court, and where officers in waiting are named, also of those officers in
Court-Martial other than a summary Court-Martial.(4)If it appears to the Court
that the accused is liable to be prejudiced at his trial by any non-compliance
with this rule, the Court shall take steps and, if necessary, adjourn to avoid
the accused being so prejudiced.

### 35. Joint trial of several accused persons .-(1) Any number of accused
persons may be charged jointly and tried together for an offence averred to
have been committed by them collectively.

(2)Any number of accused persons, although not charged jointly, may be tried
together for an offence averred to have been committed by one or more of them
and to have been abetted by the other or others.(3)Where the accused are so
charged under sub-rules (1) and (2), any one or more of them may at the same
time be charged with and tried for any other offence averred to have been
committed individually or collectively, provided that all the said offences
are based on the same facts, or form or are part of a series of offences of
the same or similar character.(4)In the cases mentioned above, notice of the
intention to try the accused persons together shall be given to each of the
accused at the time of his being informed of the charges, and any accused
person may claim, either by notice to the authority convening the Court or,
when arraigned before the Court, by notice to the Court, that he or some other
accused be tried separately on one or more of the charges included in the
charge-sheet, on the ground that the evidence of one or more of the other
accused persons proposed to be tried together with him, will be material to
his defence, or that otherwise he would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his
defence. The convening authority or Court, if satisfied that the evidence will
be material or that the accused may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his
defence as aforesaid, and if the nature of the charge admits of this, shall
allow the claim, and such accused person, or, as the case may be, the other
accused person or persons whose separate trial has been claimed, shall be
tried separately. Where any such claim has been made and disallowed by the
authority convening the Court, or by the Court, the disallowance of such claim
will not be a ground for refusing confirmation of the finding or sentence
unless, in the opinion of the confirming authority, substantial miscarriage of
justice has occurred by reason of the disallowance of such claim.

### 36. Suspension of rules on the ground of military exigencies or the
necessities of discipline .-Where it appears to the officers convening a
Court-Martial, or to the senior officer on the spot, that military exigencies,
or the necessities of discipline render it impossible or inexpedient to
observe any of the rules 23, 25, [* * *] 33 and 34 and sub-rule (2) of rule
95, he may, by order under his hand, make a declaration to that effect
specifying the nature of such exigencies or necessities, and thereupon the
trial or other proceedings shall be as valid as if the rule mentioned in such
declaration had not been contained herein; and such declaration may be made
with respect to any or all of the rules aforesaid in the case of the same
Court-Martial:

Provided that the accused shall have full opportunity of making his defence,
and shall be afforded every facility for preparing it which is practicable,
having due regard to the said exigencies or necessities.Section 2-general And
District Courts-MartialConvening of Court

### 37. Convening of general and district Courts-Martial .-(1) An officer
before convening a general or district Court-Martial shall first satisfy
himself that the charges to be tried by the Court are for offences within the
meaning of the Act, and that the evidence justifies a trial on those charges,
and if not so satisfied, shall order the release of the accused, or refer the
case to superior authority.

(2)He shall also satisfy himself that the case is a proper one to be tried by
the kind of Court-Martial which he proposes to convene.(3)The officer
convening a Court-Martial shall appoint or detail the officers to form the
Court and, may also appoint, or detail such waiting officers as he thinks
expedient. He may also, where he considers the service of an interpreter to be
necessary, appoint or detail an interpreter to the Court.(4)The officer
convening a Court-Martial shall furnish to the senior member of the Court with
the original charge-sheet on which the accused is to be tried and, where no
Judge-Advocate has been appointed, also with a copy of the summary [* * *] of
evidence and the order for the assembly of the Court-Martial. He shall also
send, to all the other members, copies of the charge-sheet and to the Judge-
Advocate when one has been appointed, a copy of the charge-sheet and a copy of
the summary [* * *] [Certain words omitted by S.R.O. 17(E), dated 6.12.1993. ]
of evidence.

### 38. Adjournment for insufficient number of officers .-(1) If, before the
accused is arraigned, the full number of officers detailed are not available
to serve, by reason of non-eligibility, disqualification, challenge or
otherwise, and if there are not a sufficient number of officers in waiting to
take the place of those unable to serve, the Court shall ordinarily adjourn
for purpose of fresh members being appointed, but if the Court is of opinion
that in the interests of justice, and for the good of the service, it is
inexpedient so to adjourn, it may, if not reduced in number below the legal
minimum, proceed, after recording their reasons for so doing.

(2)If the Court adjourns for the purpose of the appointment of fresh members,
whether under these rules or otherwise the convening officer may, if he thinks
fit, convene another Court.

or took down the summary of evidence, or was a member of a Court of inquiry
respecting the matters on which the charges against the accused are founded,

officer of the accused, or of the corps to which the accused belongs; or(e)has
a personal interest in the case.(3)The provost-marshal or assistant provost-
marshal is disqualified from serving on a general Court-Martial or district
Court-Martial.

officers of different corps or departments, and in no case exclusive of
officers of the corps or department to which the accused belongs.

(2)The members of a Court-Martial for the trial of an officer shall be of a
rank not lower than that of the officer unless, in the opinion of the
convening officer, officers of such rank are not (having due regards to the
exigencies of the public service) available. Such opinion shall be recorded in
the convening order.(3)In no case shall an officer below the rank of captain
be a member of Court-Martial for the trial of a field officer.Procedure at
trial-Constitution of Court

### 41. Inquiry by Court as to legal constitution .-(1) On the Court-
assembling, the order convening the Court shall be laid before it together
with the charge-sheet and the summary of evidence or a true copy thereof, and
also the ranks, names and corps of the officers appointed to serve on the

consists of a number of officers, not less than the minimum required by law
and, save as mentioned in rule 38, not less than the number detailed;(c)that
each of the officers so assembled is eligible and not disqualified for serving

officers are of the required rank.(2)The Court shall, further, if it is a
general or district Court-Martial to which a Judge-Advocate has been
appointed, ascertain that the Judge-Advocate is duly appointed and is not
disqualified for sitting on that Court-Martial.(3)The Court, if not satisfied
with regard to the compliance with the aforesaid provisions, shall report its
opinion to the convening authority, and may adjourn for that purpose.

### 42. Inquiry by Court as to amenability of accused and validity of charge
.-(1) If the Court is satisfied that the requirements of rule 41 have been
complied with, it shall further satisfy itself in respect of each charge about
to be brought before it-

(a)that it appears to be laid against a person subject to the Act, and subject
to the jurisdiction of the Court, and(b)that each charge discloses an offence
under the Act and is framed in accordance with these rules, and is so explicit
as to enable the accused readily to understand what he has to answer.(2)The
Court, if not satisfied on the above matters, shall report its opinion to the
convening authority and may adjourn for that purpose.Procedure at trial-
Challenge and swearing

### 43. Appearance of prosecutor and accused .-When the Court has satisfied

### 44. Proceedings for challenges of members of Court .-The order convening
the Court and the names of the presiding officer and the members of the Court
shall then be read over to the accused and he shall be asked, as required by
section 130, whether he has any objection to being tried by any officer
sitting on the Court. Any such objection shall be disposed of in accordance
with the provisions of the aforesaid section:

Provided that-(a)the accused shall state the names of all the officers
constituting the Court in respect of whom he has objection, before any
objection is disposed of,(b)the accused may call any person to give evidence
in support of his objection and such person may be questioned by the accused
and by the Court,(c)if more than one officer is objected to, the objection to
each officer shall be disposed of separately, and the objection in respect of
the officer of the lowest rank shall be disposed of first; and on an objection
to an officer, the remaining officers of the Court shall, in the absence of
the challenged officer, vote on the disposal of such objection,
notwithstanding that objections have been made to any of those
officers,(d)when an objection in respect of an officer is allowed, that
officer shall forthwith retire, and take no further part in the
proceedings,(e)when an officer so retires or is not available to serve owing
to any cause, which the Court may deem to be sufficient, and there are any
officers in waiting detailed as such, the presiding officer shall appoint one
of such officers to fill the vacancy. If there is no officer in waiting
available, the Court shall proceed as required by rule 38,(f)the eligibility,
absence of disqualification, and freedom from objection of an officer filling
a vacancy shall be ascertained by the Court, as in the case of other officers
appointed to serve on the Court.

### 45. Swearing or affirming of members .-As soon as the Court is constituted
with the proper number of officers who are not objected to, or objections in
respect of whom have been overruled, an oath or affirmation shall be
administered to every member in one of the following forms or in such other
form to the same purport as the Court ascertains to be according to his
religion or otherwise binding on his conscience.

Form of Oath"I,.........................., swear by Almighty God that I will
well and truly try the accused (or accused persons) before the Court according
to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice according to the Army
Act without partiality, favour or affection, and if any doubt shall arise,
then, according to my conscience, the best of my understanding, and the custom
of war in the like cases; and I do further swear that I will not, on any
account, at any time, whatsoever, disclose, or discover the vote or opinion of
any particular member of this Court-Martial, unless required to give evidence

persons are sworn or affirmed as above-mentioned, the accused shall be
arraigned on the charges against him.

(2)The charges upon which the accused is arraigned shall be read and, if
necessary, translated to him, and he shall be required to plead separately to
each charge.

### 49. Objection by accused to charge .-The accused, when required to plead
to any charge, may object to the charge on the ground that it does not
disclose an offence under the Act, or is not in accordance with these rules.
The Court after hearing any submission which may be made by the prosecutor or
by or on behalf of the accused, shall consider the objection in closed Court
and shall either disallow it and proceed with the trial, or allow it and
adjourn to report to the convening authority or, if it is in doubt, it may
adjourn to consult the convening authority.

### 50. Amendment of charge .-(1) At any time during the trial, if it appears
to the Court that there is any mistake in the name or description of the
accused in the charge-sheet, the Court may amend the charge-sheet so as to
correct that mistake.

(2)If, on the trial of any charge, it appears to the Court at any time before
it has begun to examine the witnesses, that in the interest of justice any
addition to, omission from, or alteration in, the charge is required, it may
report its opinion to the convening authority, and may, adjourn and the
convening authority may either direct the new trial to be commenced, or amend
the charge, and order the trial to proceed with such amended charge after due
notice to the accused.

### 51. Special plea to the jurisdiction .-(1) The accused, before pleading to
a charge, may offer a special plea to the general jurisdiction of the Court,
and if he does so, and the Court considers that anything stated in such plea
shows that the Court has no jurisdiction it shall receive any evidence offered
in support, together with any evidence offered by the prosecutor in disproof
or qualification thereof, and, any address by or on behalf of the accused and
reply by the prosecutor in reference thereto.

(2)If the Court overrules the special pleas, it shall proceed with the
trial.(3)If the Court allows the special plea, it shall record its decision,
and the reasons for it, and report it to the convening authority and adjourn;
such decision, shall not require any confirmation, and the convening authority
shall either forthwith convene another Court for the trial of the accused, or
order the accused to be released.(4)If the Court is in doubt as to the
validity of the pleas, it may refer the matter to the convening authority, and
may adjourn for that purpose or may record a special decision with respect to
such plea, and proceed with the trial.

### 52. General plea of "Guilty" or "Not Guilty".-(1) If no special plea to
general jurisdiction of the Court is offered, or if such plea being offered,
is overruled, or is dealt with by a special decision under sub-rule (4) of
rule 51, the accused person's plea "Guilty" or "Not Guilty" (or if he refuses
to plead, or does not plead intelligibly either one or the other a plea of
"Not Guilty") shall be recorded on each charge.

(2)If an accused person pleads "Guilty", that plea shall be recorded as the
finding of the Court; but before it is recorded, the presiding officer or
Judge-Advocate, on behalf of the Court, shall ascertain that the accused
understands the nature of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty and shall
inform him of the general effect of that plea, and in particular of the
meaning of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty, and of the difference in
procedure which will be made by the plea of guilty, and shall advise him to
withdraw that plea if it appears from the summary of evidence that the accused
ought to plead "Not Guilty".[(2-A) Where an accused pleads "Guilty", such plea
and the factum of compliance of sub-rule (2) of this rule, shall be recorded
by the Court in the following manner:-Before recording the plea of "Guilty" of
the accused, the Court explained to the accused the meaning of the charge(s)
to which he had pleaded "Guilty" and ascertained that the accused had
understood the nature of the charge(s) to which he had pleaded "Guilty". The
Court also informed the accused the general effect of the plea and the
difference in procedure, which will be followed consequent to the said plea.
The Court having satisfied itself that the accused understands the charge(s)
and the effect of his plea of "Guilty", accepts and records the same. The
provisions of rule 52(2) are thus complied with.](3)Where an accused pleads
"Guilty" to the first of two or more charges laid in the alternative, the
prosecutor may, after sub-rule (2) has been complied with by the Court and
before the accused is arraigned on the alternative charge or charges, withdraw
such alternative charge or charges without requiring the accused to plead
thereto and a record to that effect shall be made upon the proceedings of the
Court.(4)A plea of "Guilty" shall not be accepted in cases where the accused
is liable, if convicted to be sentenced to death, and where such plea is
offered, a plea of "Not Guilty" shall be recorded and the trial shall proceed
accordingly.

### 53. Plea in bar .-(1) The accused, at the time of his general plea of
"Guilty" or "Not Guilty" to a charge for an offence, may offer a plea in bar
of trial on the ground that-

(a)he has been previously convicted or acquitted of the offence by a competent
Criminal Court or by a Court-Martial, or has been dealt with summarily under
sections 80, 83, 84 and 85, as the case may be, for the offence, or that a
charge in respect of the offence has been dismissed as provided in sub-rule
(2) of rule 22; or(b)the offence has been pardoned or condoned by competent
military authority;(c)[ the period of limitation for trial as laid down in
section 122 has expired.](2)If he offers such plea in bar, the Court shall
record it as well as his general plea, and if it considers that any fact or
facts stated by him are sufficient to support the plea in bar, it shall
receive any evidence offered, and hear any address made by or on behalf of the
accused and the prosecutor in reference to the plea.(3)If the Court finds that
the plea in bar is proved, it shall record its finding and notify it to the
confirming authority, and shall either adjourn, or if there is any other
charge against the accused, whether in the same or in a different charge-
sheet, which is not affected by the plea in bar, may proceed to the trial of
the accused on that charge.(4)If the finding that the plea in bar is proved is
not confirmed, the Court may be re-assembled by the confirming authority, and
proceed as if the plea has been found not proved.(5)If the Court finds that
the plea in bar is not proved, it shall proceed with the trial, and the said
findings shall be subject to confirmation like any other finding of the Court.

### 54. Procedure after plea of "Guilty".-(1) Upon the record of the plea of
"Guilty", if there are other charges in the same charge-sheet to which the
plea is "Not Guilty", the trial shall first proceed with respect to the latter
charges, and after the finding on those charges, shall proceed with the
charges on which a plea of "Guilty" has been entered, but if there are
alternative charges, the Court may either proceed with respect to all the
charges as if the accused had not pleaded "Guilty" to any charge or may,
subject to sub-rule (2), instead of trying him, record a finding of "Guilty"
upon any one of the alternative charges to which he has pleaded "Guilty" and a
finding of "Not Guilty" upon all the other alternative charges.

(2)Where alternative charges are preferred and the accused pleads "Not Guilty"
to the charge which alleges the more serious offence and "Guilty" to the
other, the Court shall try him as if he had pleaded "Not Guilty" to all the
charges.(3)After the record of the plea of "Guilty" on a charge (if the trial
does not proceed on any other charges) the Court, shall receive any statement
which the accused desires to make in reference to the charge, and shall read
the summary [* * *] of evidence, and annex it to the proceedings, or if there
is no such summary [* * *] [Certain words omitted by S.R.O. 17(E), dated
6.12.1993. ] shall take and record sufficient evidence to enable it to
determine the sentence and the confirming officer to know all the
circumstances connected with the offence. This evidence shall be taken in the
manner provided in these rules in the case of plea of "Not Guilty".(4)After
evidence has been so taken, or the summary [* * *] [Certain words omitted by
S.R.O. 17(E), dated 6.12.1993. ] of evidence has been read, as the case may
be, the accused may make a statement in mitigation of punishment, and may call
witnesses as to his character.(5)If from the statement of the accused or from
the summary [* * *] [Certain words omitted by S.R.O. 17(E), dated 6.12.1993. ]
of evidence, or otherwise, it appears to the Court that the accused did not
understand the effect of his plea of "Guilty", the Court shall alter the
record and enter a plea of "Not Guilty", and proceed with the trial
accordingly.(6)If a plea of "Guilty" is recorded, and the trial proceeds with
respect to other charges in the same charge-sheet, the proceedings under sub-
rules (3) and (4) shall take place when the findings on the other charges in
the same charge-sheet are recorded.(7)When the accused states anything in
mitigation of punishment which in the opinion of the Court requires to be
proved, and would, if proved, affect the amount of punishment, the Court may
permit the accused to call witnesses to prove the same.

### 55. Withdrawal of plea of "Not Guilty" subject to compliance with sub-
rules (2) and (4) of rule 52.-The accused may, if he thinks fit, at any time
during the trial, withdraw his plea of "Not Guilty", and plead "Guilty", and
in such case the Court will at once, subject to a compliance with sub-rules
(2) and (4) of rule 52, record a plea and finding of "Guilty", and shall, so
far as is necessary, proceed in manner directed by rule 54.

### 56. Plea of "Not Guilty", application for adjournment, and case for the
prosecution .-After the plea of "Not Guilty" to any charge is recorded, the
trial shall proceed as follows, that is to say,-

(1)the Court shall ask the accused whether he wishes to apply for an
adjournment on the ground that any of the rules relating to procedure before
trial have not been complied with, and that he has been prejudiced thereby or
on the ground that he has not had sufficient opportunity for preparing his
defence, and shall record his answer;(2)if the accused shall make any such
application, the Court shall hear any statement of evidence which he may
desire to adduce in support thereof, and any statement of the prosecutor or
evidence in answer thereto; and if it shall appear to the Court that the
accused has been prejudiced by any non-compliance with any of such rules
relating to procedure or that he has not had sufficient opportunity of
preparing his defence, it may grant such adjournment as may appear to it in
the circumstances to be proper;(3)the prosecutor may, if he desires, and
shall, if so required by the Court make an opening address, and shall state
therein the substance of the charge against the accused and the nature and
general effect of the evidence which he proposes to adduce in support of it
without entering into any unnecessary detail;(4)the evidence for the
prosecution shall then be taken;(5)if it should be necessary for the
prosecutor to give evidence for the prosecution on the facts of the case, he
shall give it after the delivery of his address (if any), and he must be sworn
or affirmed, as the case may be, and give his evidence in detail; and(6)he may
be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused and afterwards may make any
statement which might be made by a witness on re-examination.[57. Plea of no
case .-(1) At the close of the case for the prosecution, the accused may offer
a plea that the evidence given on behalf of the prosecution, in respect of any
one or more charges, has not established a prima facie case against him and
that he should not, therefore, be called upon to make his defence to that
charge or charges.(2)Where the accused takes such a plea, the prosecutor may
address the Court in answer thereto and the accused may reply.(3)The Court
shall consider the plea in closed Court and shall not allow the plea unless
satisfied that-(a)the prosecution has not established a prima facie case on
the charge or charges as laid; and(b)it is not open to it on the evidence
adduced to make a special finding either under section 139 or sub-rule (4) of
rule 62.(4)If the Court allows the plea, it shall record a finding of "Not
Guilty" on the charge or charges, to which the plea relates, and shall
announce the finding forthwith in open Court as subject to confirmation.(5)If
the Court overrules the plea, it shall proceed with the trial.(6)If the Court
has any doubt as to the validity of the plea, it may refer the matter to the
convening authority, and adjourn for that purpose.(7)The Court may, of its own
motion, after the close of the case for the prosecution, and after hearing the
prosecutor find the accused "Not Guilty" of the charge, and announce the
finding forthwith in open Court as subject to confirmation.(8)The Court shall
record brief reasons while arriving at the finding on the plea, in accordance
with sub-rule (1) of rule 62.]

### 58. [ Examination of the accused and defence witnesses

.-(1)(a) In every trial, for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to
explain any circumstances appearing in evidence against him, the Court of the

the case for the prosecution and before he is called on for his defence,
question him generally on the case.(b)No oath shall be administered to the
accused when he is examined under clause (a).(c)The accused shall not render
himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer questions referred in
clause (a) above, or by giving answer to them which he knows not to be
true.(2)After the close of the case for the prosecution, the presiding officer
or the Judge-Advocate, if any, shall explain to the accused that he may make
an unsworn statement, orally or in writing, giving his account of the subject
of the charge(s) against him or if he wishes, he may give evidence as a
witness, on oath or affirmation, in disproof of the charge(s) against him or
any person charged together with him at the same trial:Provided that,-(a)he
shall not be called as a witness except on his own request in writing;(b)his
failure to give evidence shall not be made the subject of any comment by any
or the parties of the Court or give rise to any presumption against himself or
any person charged together with him at the same trial;(c)if he gives evidence
on oath or affirmation, he shall be examined as first witness for defence and
shall be liable to be cross-examined by the prosecutor and to be questioned by
the Court.(3)The accused may then call his witnesses including, if he so
desires, any witnesses as to character. If the accused intends to call
witnesses as to the facts of the case other than himself, he may make an
opening address before the evidence for defence is given.]

### 59. [ Closing addresses

.-After the examination of the witnesses, the prosecutor may make a closing
address and the accused or his counsel or the defending officer, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to reply:Provided that where any point of law is
raised by the accused, the prosecutor may, with the permission of the Court,
make his submission with regard to that point.][* * *] [R. 59-A omitted by

Guilty". After recording the finding on each charge, the Court shall give
brief reasons in support thereof. The Judge-Advocate or, if these is none, the
presiding officer shall record or cause to be recorded such brief reasons in
the proceedings. The above record shall be signed and dated by the presiding
officer and the Judge-Advocate, if any.]

(2)Where the Court is of opinion as regards any charge that the facts proved
do not disclose the offence charged or any offence of which he might under the
Act legally be found guilty on the charge as laid, the Court shall acquit the
accused of that charge.(3)If the Court doubts as regards any charge whether
the facts proved show the accused to be guilty or not of the offence charged
or of any offence of which he might under this Act legally be found guilty on
the charge as laid, it may, before recording a finding on that charge, refer
to the confirming authority for an opinion, setting out the facts which it
finds to be proved, and may if necessary, adjourn for that purpose.(4)Where
the Court is of opinion as regards any charge that the facts which it finds to
be proved in evidence differ materially from the facts alleged in the
statement of particulars in the charge, but are nevertheless sufficient to
prove the offence stated in the charge, and that the difference is not so
material as to have prejudiced the accused in his defence, it may, instead of
a finding of "Not Guilty", record a special finding.(5)The special finding may
find the accused guilty on a charge subject to the statement or exceptions or
variations specified therein.(6)Where there are alternative charges, and the
facts proved appear to the Court not to constitute the offence mentioned in
any of those alternative charges, the Court shall record a finding of "Not
Guilty" on that charge.(7)The Court shall not find the accused guilty on more
than one or two or more charges laid down in the alternative, even if
conviction upon the charge necessarily connotes guilty upon the alternative
charge or charges.(8)If the Court thinks that the facts proved constitute one
of the offences stated in two or more of the alternative charges, but doubts
which of those offences the facts do at law constitute, it may, before
recording a finding on those charges, refer to the confirming authority for an
opinion, setting out the facts which it finds to be proved and stating that it
doubts whether those facts constitute in law the offence stated in such one or
other of the charges and may, if necessary, adjourn for that purpose.(9)In any
case where the Court is empowered by section 139 to find the accused guilty of
an offence other than that charged, or guilty of committing an offence in
circumstances involving a less degree of punishment, or where it could, after
hearing the evidence, have made a special finding of guilty subject to
exceptions or variations in accordance with sub-rules (4) and (5) it may, if
it is satisfied of the justice of such course, and if the concurrence of the
convening officer is signified by the prosecutor, accept and record a plea of
guilty of such other offences or of the offence as having been committed in
circumstances involving such less degree of punishment or of the offence
charged subject to such exceptions or variations:Provided that failure to
obtain the concurrence of the convening officer as aforesaid shall not
invalidate the proceedings when confirmed notwithstanding such failure.(10)The
finding on each charge shall be announced forthwith in open Court as subject
to confirmation.

### 63. Procedure on acquittal .-If the finding on all the charges is "Not
Guilty", the presiding officer shall date and sign the finding and such
signature shall authenticate the whole of the proceedings, and the proceedings
upon being signed by the Judge-Advocate (if any) shall be at once transmitted
for confirmation.

### 64. Procedure on conviction .-(1) If the finding on any charge is "Guilty"
then, for the guidance of the Court in determining its sentence, and of the
confirming authority in considering the sentence, the Court, before
deliberating on its sentence, shall, whenever possible, take evidence of and

gallantry or distinguished conduct of the accused, any previous convictions of
the accused either by a Court-Martial or a Criminal Court any previous
punishments awarded to him by an officer exercising authority under section
80, 83, 84 or 85, as the case may be, the length of time he has been in arrest
or in confinement on any previous sentence, and any military decoration, or
military reward, of which he may be in possession or to which he is entitled.

(2)Evidence on the above matters may be given by a witness verifying a
statement which contains a summary of the entries in the regimental books
respecting the accused and identifying the accused as the person referred to
in that summary.(3)The accused may cross-examine any such witness, and may
call witnesses to rebut such evidence; and if the accused so requests, the
regimental books, or a duly certified copy of the material entries therein,
shall be produced, and if the accused alleges that the summary is in any
respect not in accordance with the regimental book, or such certified copy, as
the case may be, the Court shall compare the summary with those books, or
copy, and if it finds it is not in accordance therewith, shall cause the
summary to be corrected.(4)When all the evidence on the above matters has been
given, the accused may address the Court thereon and in mitigation of
punishment.

### 65. Sentence .-The Court shall award a single sentence in respect of all
the offences of which the accused is found guilty, and such sentence shall be

which it can be legally given, and not to be awarded in respect of any offence
in a charge in respect of which it cannot be legally given.

### 66. Recommendation of mercy .-(1) If the Court makes a recommendation of
mercy, it shall give its reasons for its recommendation.

fresh evidence shall be adduced.(3)The Court may, on a request from the
prosecutor, in the interest of justice, allow a witness to be called or re-
called for the purpose of rebutting any material statement made by a witness
for the defence during revision.(4)After the revision order has been read in
open Court, whether the revision is of finding or sentence and the evidence,
if any, in accordance with sub-rules (1), (2) and (3) has been taken, the

relating to the case. The Court shall then deliberate on its finding or the
sentence, as the case may be, in closed Court.(5)Where the finding is sent
back for revision and the Court does not adhere to its former finding, it
shall revoke the finding and sentence, and record the new finding, in the
manner laid down in rule 62, and if such new finding involves a sentence, pass
sentence afresh, after complying with rule 64.(6)Where the sentence alone is

### 72. Mitigation of sentence on partial confirmation .-(1) Where a sentence
has been awarded by a Court-Martial in respect of offences in several charges,
and the confirming authority confirms the finding on some but not on all of
such charges, that authority shall take into consideration the fact of such
non-confirmation, and shall if it seems just, mitigate, remit, or commute the
punishment awarded according as it seems just, having regard to the offences
in the charges in respect of the findings which are confirmed.

(2)Where a sentence has been awarded by a Court-Martial in respect of offences
in several charges and has been confirmed, and any one of such charges the
finding thereon is found to be invalid, the authority having power to

with the Act, rules made thereunder and in a manner befitting a Court of
justice.

(2)It is the duty of the presiding officer to see that justice is
administered, that the accused has a fair trial, and that he does not suffer
any disadvantage in consequence of his position as a person under trial, or of
his ignorance, or of his incapacity to examine or cross-examine witnesses, or
otherwise.

### 77. Power of Court over address of prosecutor and accused .-(1) It is the
duty of the prosecutor to assist the Court in the administration of justice,
to behave impartially, to bring the whole of the transaction before the Court,
and not to take any unfair advantage of, or suppress any evidence in favour
of, the accused.

(2)The prosecutor may not refer to any matter, not relevant to the charge or
charges then before the Court, and it is the duty of the Court to stop him
from so doing and also restrain any undue violence of language or want of
fairness or moderation on the part of the prosecutor.(3)The Court shall allow
great latitude to the accused in making his defence; he must abstain from any
remarks contemptuous or disrespectful towards the Court, and from coarse and
insulting language towards others, but he may for the purposes of his defence
impeach the evidence and the motives of the witnesses and the prosecutor, and
charge other persons with blame and even criminality, subject, if he does so,
to any liability which he may thereby incur. The Court may caution the accused
as to the irrelevance of his defence, but shall not, unless in special cases,
stop his defence solely on ground of such irrelevance.

### 78. Procedure on trial of accused persons together .-Where two or more
accused persons are tried together and any evidence as to the facts of the
case is tendered by any one or more of them, the evidence and addresses on the
part of or on behalf of all the accused persons shall be taken before the
prosecutor replies, and the prosecutor shall make one address only in reply as
regards all the accused persons.

### 79. Separate charge-sheets .-(1) The convening officer may direct any
charges against an accused person to be inserted in different charge-sheets,
and when he so directs, the accused shall be arraigned and until after the
finding tried, upon each charge-sheet separately, and the procedure in rules
48 to 62, both inclusive, shall, until after finding, be followed in respect
of each of charge-sheet, as if it contained the whole of the charges against
the accused.

(2)The trials upon the several charge-sheets shall be in such order as the
convening officer directs.(3)When the Court have tried the accused upon all
the charge-sheets they shall, in the case of the finding being "Not Guilty" on
all the charges, proceed, as directed by rule 63, and in case of the finding
on any one or more of the charges being "Guilty" proceed as directed by rules
54 and 64 to 67, both inclusive, in like manner in each case as if all the
charges in the different charge-sheets had been contained in one charge-sheet,
and the sentence passed shall be of the same effect as if all the charges had
been contained in one charge-sheet.(4)If the convening officer directs that,
in the event of the conviction of an accused person upon a charge in any
charge-sheet, he need not be tried upon the subsequent charge-sheets the Court
in such event may, without trying the accused upon any of the subsequent
charge-sheets, proceed as provided in sub-rule (3).(5)Where a charge-sheet
contains more than one charge, the accused may, before pleading claim to be
tried separately in respect of any charge or charges in that charge-sheet, on
the ground that he will be embarrassed in his defence if he is not so tried
separately; and in such case the Court, unless they think his claim
unreasonable, shall arraign and try the accused in like manner as if the
convening officer had inserted the said charge or charges in different charge-
sheets.(6)If a plea of "Guilty", to any charge in a charge-sheet has been
recorded as the finding of the Court, the provisions of sub-rules (3) and (4)
of rule 54 shall not be complied with until after the Court had arrived at its
findings on all the charge-sheets.

all other persons not entitled to be present.(4)Except as hereinbefore
mentioned all proceedings, including the view of any place, shall be in open
Court and in the presence of the accused subject to sub-rule (5).(5)The Court
shall have the power to exclude from the Court any witness who has yet to give
evidence or any other person, other than the accused, who interferes with its
proceedings.[80-A. Courts-Martial to be public.-Subject to rule 80, the place
in which a Court-Martial is held for the purpose of trying an offence under
the Act shall be deemed to be an open Court to which the public generally may
have access, so far as the same can conveniently contain them:Provided that if
the Court is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient in the public
interest or for the ends of justice so to do, the Court may at any stage of
the trial of any particular case order that the public generally or any
portion thereof or any particular person shall not have access to, or be or
remain in, the place in which the Court is held.]

shall sit for more than six hours in any one day.

(2)If the Court considers it necessary to continue the trial after six in the
afternoon or to sit for more than six hours in any one day, it may do so but
if it does so, should record in the proceedings the reason for so doing.(3)In
cases requiring an immediate example or when the convening officer certifies
under his hand that it is expedient for the public service, trials may be held
at any hour.(4)If the Court or the convening officer or other superior
military authority thinks that military exigencies or the interests of
discipline require the Court to sit on Sunday or on any other day declared as
a holiday in Army or Command Orders, the Court may sit accordingly, but
otherwise the Court shall not sit on any of those days.

### 82. Continuity of trial and adjournment of Court .-(1) When a Court is
once assembled and the accused has been arraigned, the Court shall continue
the trial from day to day, in accordance with rule 81, unless it appears to
the Court that an adjournment is necessary for the ends of justice or that
such continuance is impracticable.

(2)A Court may adjourn from time to time and from place to place and may, when
necessary, view any place.(3)The senior officer on the spot may also, for
military exigencies, adjourn or prolong the adjournment of the Court.(4)A
Court-Martial, in the absence of a Judge-Advocate (if such has been appointed
for that Court-Martial) shall not proceed, and shall adjourn.(5)If the time to
which an adjournment is made is not specified, the adjournment shall be until

the facts to the convening authority.

### 85. Death, retirement or absence of presiding officer .-In the case of the
death, retirement or unavoidable absence of the presiding officer, the next

### 86. Presence throughout of all members of Court .-(1) A member of a Court
who has been absent while any part of the evidence on the trial of an accused
person is taken, shall take no further part in the trial by that Court of that
person, but the Court will not be affected unless it is reduced below the
legal minimum.

(2)An officer shall not be added to a Court-Martial after the accused has been
arraigned.

### 87. Taking of opinions of members of Court .-(1) Every member of a Court

(2)In the case of several accused persons to be tried separately, the Court,
upon one of those persons objecting to a member, may, according as it thinks
fit, proceed to determine that objection or postpone the case of that person
and swear or affirm the members of the Court for the trial of the others
alone.(3)In the case of several accused persons to be tried separately, the
Court when sworn or affirmed, shall proceed with one case postponing the other
cases, and taking them afterwards in succession.(4)Where several accused
persons are tried separately by the same Court upon charges arising out of the
same transaction, the Court may, if it considers it to be desirable in the
interests of justice, postpone consideration of any sentence to be awarded to
any one or more of such accused persons until the trials of all such accused
persons have completed.

### 90. Swearing of interpreter and shorthand writer .-(1) At any time during
the trial an impartial person may, if the Court thinks it necessary and shall,
if either the prosecutor or the accused requests it on any reasonable ground,
be sworn or affirmed to act as interpreter.

(2)An impartial person may at any time of the trial, if the Court thinks it
desirable, be sworn or affirmed to act as a shorthand writer.(3)Before a
person is sworn or affirmed as an interpreter or shorthand writer, the accused

and the Court, if it thinks that the objection is reasonable, shall not swear
or affirm that person as interpreter or shorthand writer.

### 91. Evidence when to be translated .-When any evidence is given in a
language which any of the officers composing the Court, the Judge-Advocate,

understand, that evidence shall be interpreted to such officer or person in a
language which he does understand. If an interpreter in such language has been
appointed by the convening officer, and duly sworn or affirmed, the evidence
shall be interpreted by him. If no such interpreter has been appointed and
sworn or affirmed, an impartial person shall be sworn or affirmed by the Court

interpreted as appears necessary.

or on behalf of, the prosecutor or the accused, is not in writing, it shall
not be necessary to record the same in the proceedings further or otherwise
than the Court thinks proper, except that-(a)the Court shall in every case
make such record of the defence made by the accused as will enable the
confirming officer to judge of the reply made by, or on behalf of, the accused

matters in the address by or on behalf of, the prosecutor or the accused which
the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, may require.(5)The Court

accused person [* * *] [Certain words omitted by S.R.O. 407, dated 28.12.1958.
] desires to have a defending officer assigned to represent him at his trial

prosecutor, but in that case, unless the notice referred to in sub-rule (1)
has been given by the accused, notice of the direction for counsel to appear
shall be given to the accused at such time (not in any case less than seven
days) before the trial, as would, in the opinion of the Court, have enabled
the accused to obtain counsel to assist him at the trial.(3)The counsel, who
appears before a Court-Martial on behalf of the prosecutor or accused, shall
have the same right as the prosecutor or accused for whom he appears, to call,
and orally examine, cross-examine, and re-examine witnesses, to make an

guilty and shall inform him of the general effect of that plea, and in
particular of the meaning of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty and of
the difference in procedure which will be made by the plea of guilty, and

itself that the accused understands the charge(s) and the effect of his plea
of "Guilty", accepts and records the same. The provisions of rule 115(2) are
thus complied with.](3)Where an accused person pleads guilty to the first of

without requiring the accused to plead thereto, and a record to that effect
shall be made upon the proceedings of the Court.

### 116. Procedure after plea of "Guilty".-(1) Upon the record of the plea of
"Guilty", if there are other charges in the same charge-sheet to which the

charges, and, after the finding of these charges, shall proceed with the
charges on which a plea of "Guilty" has been entered; but if they are
alternative charges, the Court may either proceed with respect to all the
charges as if the accused had not pleaded "Guilty" to any charge, or may,
instead of trying him, record a finding upon any one of the alternative
charges to which he has pleaded "Guilty" and a finding of "Not Guilty" upon
all the other alternative charges.

(2)After the record of the plea of "Guilty" on a charge (if the trial does not
proceed on any other charges), the Court shall read the summary of evidence,
and annex it to the proceedings or if there is no such summary, shall take and
record sufficient evidence to enable it to determine the sentence, and the
reviewing officer to know all the circumstances connected with the offence.
The evidence shall be taken in like manner as is directed by these rules in
case of a plea of "Not Guilty".(3)After such evidence has been taken, or the
summary of evidence has been read, as the case may be, the accused may address
the Court in reference to the charge and in mitigation of punishment and may
call witnesses as to his character.(4)If from the statement of the accused, or
from the summary of evidence, or otherwise, it appears to the Court that the
accused did not understand the effect of the plea of "Guilty", the Court shall
alter the record and enter a plea of "Not Guilty", and proceed with the trial
accordingly.(5)If a plea of "Guilty" is recorded and the trial proceeds with
respect to other charges in the same charge-sheet, the proceedings under sub-
rules (2) and (3) shall take place when the findings on the other charges in
the same charge-sheet are recorded.(6)When the accused states anything in
mitigation of punishment which in the opinion of the Court requires to be
proved, and would, if proved, effect the amount of punishment, the Court may
permit the accused to call witnesses to prove the same.(7)In any case where
the Court is empowered by section 139 to find the accused guilty of an offence
other than that charged, or guilty of committing an offence in circumstances
involving a less degree of punishment, or where it could, after hearing the
evidence, have made a special finding of guilty subject to exceptions of
variations in accordance with sub-rule (3) of rule 121, it may, if it is
satisfied of the justice of such course accept and record a plea of guilty of
such other offence, or of the offence as having been committed in
circumstances involving such less degree of punishment, or of the offence
charged subject to such exceptions or variations.

### 117. Withdrawal of plea of "Not Guilty".-The accused may, if he thinks
fit, at any time during the trial withdraw his plea of "Not Guilty" and plead
"Guilty", and in such case the Court shall at once, subject to a compliance
with sub-rule (2) of rule 115, record a plea and finding of "Guilty", and
shall, so far as may be, proceed in the manner provided in rule 116.

### 118. Procedure after plea of "Not Guilty".-After the plea of "Not Guilty"
to any charge is recorded, the evidence for the prosecution shall be taken. At
the close of the evidence for the prosecution, the accused shall be asked if
he has anything to say in his defence, and may address the Court in his
defence, or may defer such address until he has called his witnesses. The
Court may question the accused on the case for the purpose of enabling him to
explain any circumstances appearing in his statement or in the evidence
against him. The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by
refusing to answer such questions, or by giving answers to them which he knows
not to be true; but [* * *]. No oath shall be administered to the accused.

The accused may then call his witnesses, including also witnesses to
character.

### 119. Witnesses in reply to defence .-The Court may, if it thinks it
necessary in the interest of justice, call witnesses, in reply to the defence.

### 120. Verdict .-After all the evidence, both for prosecution and defence,
has been heard, the Court shall give its opinion as to whether the accused is
guilty or not guilty of the charges.

### 121. Form and record of finding .-(1) The finding on every charge upon
which the accused is arraigned shall be recorded, and except as mentioned in
these rules, such finding shall be recorded simply as a finding of "Guilty",
or of "Not Guilty".

(2)When the Court is of opinion as regards any charge that the facts proved do
not disclose the offence charged or any offence of which he might under the
Act legally be found guilty on the charge as laid, the Court shall acquit the
accused of that charge.(3)When the Court is of opinion as regards any charge
that the facts found to be proved in evidence differ materially from the facts
alleged in the statement of particulars in the charge, but are nevertheless
sufficient to prove the offence stated in the charge, and that the difference
is not so material as to have prejudiced the accused in his defence, it may,
instead of a finding of "Not Guilty", record a special finding.(4)The special
finding may find the accused guilty on a charge subject to the statement of
exceptions or variations specified therein.(5)The Court shall not find the
accused guilty on more than one of two or more charges laid down in the
alternative, even if conviction upon one charge necessarily connotes guilty
upon the alternative charge or charges.

### 122. Procedure on acquittal .-If the finding on each of the charges in a
charge-sheet is "Not Guilty" the Court shall date and sign the proceedings,
the findings shall be announced in open Court, and the accused will be
released in respect of those charges.

### 123. Procedure on conviction .-(1) If the finding on any charge is
"Guilty", the Court may record of its own knowledge, or take evidence of and
record, the general character, age, service, rank and any recognised acts of
gallantry or distinguished conduct of the accused, and previous convictions of
the accused either by a Court-Martial, or a Criminal Court, any previous
punishments awarded to him by an officer exercising authority under section
80; the length of time he has been in arrest or in confinement on any previous
sentence, and any military decoration, or military reward, of which he may be
in possession or to which he is entitled.

(2)If the Court does not record the matters mentioned in this rule of its own
knowledge, evidence on these matters may be taken in the manner provided in
rule 64 for similar evidence at general and district Court-Martial.

### 124. Sentence .-The Court shall award one sentence in respect of all the
offences of which the accused is found guilty.

### 125. Signing of proceedings .-The Court shall date and sign the sentence
and such signature shall authenticate the whole of the proceedings.

### 126. Charges in different charge-sheets .-When the charges at a trial by
summary Court-Martial are contained in different charge-sheets, the procedure
laid down for general and district Court-Martial when trying charges contained
in different charge-sheets shall, so far as may be applicable, be followed.

### 127. Clearing of Court .-(1) The officer holding the trial may clear the
Court to consider the evidence or to consult with the officers or junior
commissioned officers, attending the trial.

(2)Except as above-mentioned, all the proceedings, including the view of any
place, shall be in open Court, and in the presence of the accused.

### 128. Adjournment .-A summary Court-Martial may adjourn from time to time
and from place to place, and may, when necessary, view any place.

### 129. Friend of accused .-In any summary Court-Martial, an accused person
may have a person to assist him during the trial, whether a legal advisor or
any other person. A person so assisting him may advise him on all points and
suggest the questions to be put to witnesses, but shall not examine or cross-
examine witnesses or address the Court.

### 130. Memorandum to be attached to proceedings .-An explanatory memorandum
is to be attached to the proceedings when a summary Court-Martial tries,
without reference, an offence which should not ordinarily be so tried.

### 131. Promulgation .-The sentence of a summary Court-Martial shall (except
as provided in rule 132) be promulgated in the manner usual in the service, at
the earliest opportunity after it has been pronounced and shall be carried out
without delay after promulgation.

### 132. Promulgation to be deferred in certain circumstances .-When the
officer holding the trial has less than five years' service, the sentence of a
summary Court-Martial shall not (except on active service) be carried out
until approved by superior authority as provided in sub-section (2) of section
161.

### 133. Review of proceedings .-The proceedings of a summary Court-Martial
shall, immediately on promulgation, be forwarded (through the Deputy Judge-
Advocate-General of the command in which the trial is held) to the officer
authorised to deal with them in pursuance of section 162. After review by him,
they will be returned to the accused person's corps for preservation in
accordance with sub-rule (2) of rule 146.

that he may cross-examine them, and shall, for this reason, so far as
practicable, secure the attendance of all such witnesses.

### 135. Calling of witness whose evidence is not contained in summary .-If
the prosecutor, or, in the case of a summary Court-Martial, the Court intends
to call a witness whose evidence is not contained in any summary [* * *] of
evidence given to the accused, notice of the intention shall be given to the
accused a reasonable time before the witness is called together with an
abstract of his proposed evidence; and if such witness is called without such
notice [* * *] [Certain words omitted by S.R.O. 17(E), dated 6.12.1993. ]
having been given the Court shall, if the accused so desires it, either
adjourn after taking the evidence of the witness, or allow the cross-
examination of such witness to be postponed and the Court shall inform the
accused of his right to demand such adjournment or postponement.

### 136. List of witnesses of accused .-The accused shall not be required to
give to the prosecutor or Court a list of the witnesses whom he intends to
call, but it shall rest with the accused alone to secure the attendance of any

attendance the accused has not requested steps to be taken as provided by sub-
rule (1) of rule 3.

### 137. Procuring attendance of witnesses .-(1) In the case of trial by
general or district Court-Martial, the commanding officer of the accused, the
convening officer or, after the assembly of the Court, the presiding officer,

procured, but the person requiring the attendance of a witness may be required
to undertake to defray the cost (if any) of their attendance.

(2)The Court shall, in the case of trials by summary Court-Martial, take
proper steps to procure the attendance of the witnesses whom the accused
desires to call and whose attendance can reasonably be procured, but the
accused may be required to undertake to defray the cost (if any) of their
attendance.

### 138. Procedure when essential witness is absent .-If such proper steps as
mentioned in the preceding rule have not been taken as to any witness, or if
any witness whose attendance could not be reasonably procured before the
assembly of the Court is essential to the prosecution or defence, the Court
shall-

(a)take steps to procure the issue of a commission for the examination of such
witness; or(b)if it is a general or district Court-Martial, adjourn and report
the circumstances to the convening officer; or(c)if it is a summary Court-
Martial, adjourn to enable the witness to attend, or adopt such other course
as appears to the officer holding the trial best calculated to do justice.

### 139. Withdrawal of witnesses from Court .-During the trial a witness,
other than the prosecutor, shall not, except by special leave of the Court, be
permitted to be present in Court while not under examination and if, while he
is under examination, a discussion arises as to the allowance of a question,
or the sufficiency of his answers, or otherwise as to his evidence, he may be
directed to withdraw.

### 140. Oath or affirmation to be administered to witnesses .-An oath or
affirmation shall, if so required by the Act, be administered to every witness
before he gives his evidence by the Judge-Advocate (if any), a member of the
Court, or some other person empowered by the Court in one of the following
forms or in such other form to the same purport as the Court ascertains to be
according to the religion or otherwise binding on the conscience of the
witness.

Form of Oath"I,............................, swear by almighty God that what I
shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth."Forms of Affirmation"I,......................., do solemnly, sincerely
and truly declare and affirm that what I shall state shall be the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth."

### 141. Mode of questioning witness .-(1) Every question shall be put to a
witness orally by the officer holding the trial, by the prosecutor, by or on
behalf of the accused or by the Judge-Advocate and the witness will forthwith
reply, unless an objection is made by the Court, Judge-Advocate, prosecutor,
or accused, in which case he shall not reply until the objection is disposed
of. The witness shall address his reply to the Court.

(2)The evidence of a witness as taken down shall be read to him if he so
requests before he leaves the Court, and shall, if necessary, be corrected. If
he makes any explanation or correction, the prosecutor and accused or counsel
or the defending officer may respectively examine him respecting the
same.(3)If the witness denies the correctness of any part of the evidence when
the same is read over to him, the Court may instead of correcting the
evidence, record the objection made to it by the witness.(4)If the evidence is
not given in English and the witness does not understand that language, the
evidence as recorded, shall be interpreted to him in the language in which it
was given, or in a language which he understands if he so requests before he
leaves the Court.(5)Where evidence is recorded by shorthand writer, it shall
not be necessary to read the evidence of the witness to him under sub-rule (2)
or (4), if, in the opinion of the Court and the Judge-Advocate, if any (such

Advocate (if any), or the officer holding the trial, shall also put to the
witness any question relative to that answer which the prosecutor or the
accused or counsel or the defending officer may request him to put and which
the Court deem reasonable.

### 143. Re-calling of witnesses and calling of witnesses in reply .-(1) At
the request of the prosecutor or of the accused, a witness may, by leave of

of the Court) for the purpose of having any question put to him through the
presiding officer, the Judge-Advocate (if any), or the officer holding the
trial.

(2)The Court may, if it considers it expedient, in the interests of justice,
so to do, allow a witness to be called or recalled by the prosecutor, before
the closing address of or on behalf of the accused for the purpose of
rebutting any material statement made by a witness for the defence or for the
purpose of giving evidence on any new matter which the prosecutor could not
reasonably have foreseen.(3)Where the accused has called witnesses to
character, the prosecutor before the closing address of or on behalf of the
accused, may call or re-call witnesses for the purpose of proving a previous
conviction of entries in the defaulters book, against the accused.(4)The Court
may call or recall any witness at any time before the finding, if it considers
that it is necessary for the ends of justice.Addresses

reasons in support thereof. The Judge-Advocate, if any, or the presiding
officer or in the case of summary Court-Martial, the officer holding the
trial, shall record or cause to be recorded such brief reasons in the
proceedings.(2)The presiding officer or in the case of summary Court-Martial,
the officer holding the trial, shall date and sign the above record, and the
proceedings, upon being signed by the Judge-Advocate, if any, shall at once be
transmitted to the confirming officer or to the authority empowered to deal

proceedings

### 146. Preservation of proceedings .-(1) The proceedings of a Court-Martial
(other than a summary Court-Martial) shall, after promulgation, be forwarded,

than three years, with the records of the corps or department to which the

time and free of cost, including the proceedings upon revision, if any.]

[147-A. Copy of proceedings not to be given in certain cases.-Notwithstanding
anything contained in rule 147, if the Central Government certifies that it is
against for interests of the security of the State or friendly relations with
foreign States to supply a copy of the proceedings or any part thereof under
the said rule, he shall not be furnished with such copy:Provided that if the
Central Government is satisfied that the person demanding the copy is desirous
of submitting a petition in accordance with the Act or instituting any action
in a Court of law in relation to the finding or sentence, it shall permit
inspection of the proceedings to such person or his legal adviser, if any, on
the following conditions, namely:-(a)the inspection shall be made at such
times and such places as the Central Government or any authority authorised by
it, may direct; and(b)the person allowed to inspect the proceedings shall,
before such inspection furnish-(i)an undertaking, in writing, that he shall
not make copies of the proceedings or any part thereof and that the
information or documents contained in such proceedings shall not be used by
him, for any purpose whatsoever other than for the purpose of submitting a
petition in accordance with the Act or instituting an action in a Court of law
in relation to the said finding or sentence; and(ii)a certificate that he is
aware that he may render himself liable to prosecution under sections 3 and 5
of the Indian Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923), if he commits any act
specified in the said sections in relation to the documents or information
contained in the said proceedings.]

### 148. Loss of proceedings .-(1) If, before confirmation, the original
proceedings of a Court-Martial which require confirmation or any part thereof,
are lost, a copy thereof, if any, certified by the presiding officer of or the
Judge-Advocate at the Court-Martial may be accepted in lieu of the original.

(2)If there is no such copy, and sufficient evidence of the charge, finding,
sentence and transactions of the Court can be procured, that evidence may,
with the assent of the accused, be accepted in lieu of the original
proceedings, or part thereof, which have lost.(3)In any case above in this
rule mentioned, the finding and sentence may be confirmed and shall be as
valid as if the original proceedings, or part thereof, had not been lost.(4)If
the accused refuses the assent referred to in sub-rule (2), he may be tried
again, and the finding and sentence of the previous Court of which the
proceedings have been lost shall be void.(5)If, after confirmation or in any
case where confirmation is not required, the original proceedings of a Court-
Martial or any part thereof are lost, and there is sufficient evidence of the
charge, finding, sentence, and transactions of the Court and of the
confirmation (if required) of the finding and sentence, that evidence shall be
a valid and sufficient record of the trial for all purposes.Irregular
procedure when no injustice is done

### 149. Validity of irregular procedure in certain cases .-Whenever, it
appears that a Court-Martial had jurisdiction to try any person and make a
finding and that there is legal evidence or a plea of guilty to justify such
finding and any sentence which the Court-Martial had jurisdiction to pass
thereon may be confirmed, and shall, if so confirmed and in the case of a
summary Court-Martial where confirmation is not necessary, be valid,
notwithstanding any deviation from these rules or notwithstanding that the
charge-sheet has not been signed by the commanding officer or the convening
officer, provided that the charges have, in fact, before trial been approved
by the commanding officer and the convening officer or notwithstanding any
defect or objection, technical or other, unless it appears that any injustice
has been done to the offender, and where any finding and sentence are
otherwise valid, they shall not be invalid by reason only of a failure to
administer an oath or affirmation to the interpreter or shorthand writer; but
nothing in this rule shall relieve an officer from any responsibility for any
wilful or negligent disregard of any of these rules.

Offences of witnesses and others

### 150. Offences of witnesses and others .-When any Court-Martial is of
opinion that there is ground for inquiring into any offence specified in
sections 59 and 60 and committed before it or brought under its notice in the
course of its proceedings, or into any act done before it or brought under its
notice in the course of its proceedings, which would, if done by a person
subject to the Act, have constituted such an offence, such Court-Martial may
proceed as follows, that is to say-

(1)If the person who appears to have committed the offence is subject to the
Act, the Court may bring his conduct to the notice of the proper military
authority, and may also order him to be placed in military custody with a view
to his punishment by an officer exercising authority under section 80, 83, 84
or 85 or to his trial by a Court-Martial.(2)If the person who appears to have
done the act is amenable to naval or air force law, the Court may bring his
conduct to the notice of the proper naval or air force authority, as the case
may be.(3)If the person who appears to have done the act is not subject to
military, naval or air force law, then in the case of acts which would, if
done by a person subject to the act, have constituted an offence under clause
(a), (b), (c) or (d) of section 59, the officer who summoned the witness to
appear or the presiding officer or officer holding the Court, as the case may
be, may forward a written complaint to the nearest Magistrate of the first
class having jurisdiction, and in the case of acts which would, if done as
aforesaid, have constituted an offence under clause (e) of section 59 or
section 60, the Court, after making any preliminary inquiry that may be
necessary, may send the case to the nearest Magistrate of the first class
having jurisdiction for inquiry or trial in accordance with [section 340 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)].Section 5-summary General

circumstances prevent compliance with sub-rule (1), he may direct that the
trial will be carried on without any such brief record being taken down.(3)If

read and attached to the proceedings, and it shall not be necessary for the

MARTIALThe following memoranda as to Courts-Martial are intended for the
guidance of commanding and convening officers and others with a view to
securing uniformity of practice and to avoiding some common mistakes.These
memoranda do not form part of the Appendices to the Army Rules, 1954.SUMMARY
OF EVIDENCE

### 1\. The officer detailed to record a summary of evidence should--

(a)Make himself acquainted with all the circumstances of the case and the
testimony of the witnesses who gave evidence before the CO, and carefully
consider whether the additional evidence is relevant and necessary [See Army
Rule 23(1)]. Intelligent and patient investigation will often result in the
discovery of a missing link in the chain of evidence, of corroborating
evidence, or of evidence tending to exculpate the accused. It may even save an
unnecessary or abortive Court-Martial.(b)Before taking down the
evidence--(i)Consider what offence or offences appear to have been
committed.(ii)Consider the essential elements of such offence, or of each
offence.(iii)Consider what facts and circumstances must be proved in order to
establish not only the commission of an offence but also the commission of it
by the accused, i.e., what facts are relevant to the issue.(iv)Consider what
evidence should be adduced in order to prove each material fact; in other
words, how it is proposed to prove each of the necessary facts by admissible
evidence. He will generally find it convenient to ascertain from each witness
roughly what evidence that witness can give before actually taking down the
evidence.(c)When reducing the evidence of witnesses to writing(i)Take down the
evidence and arrange it, both in the statements of witnesses and in the
summary, as far as possible so that events are set out in chronological order
and the Court may have a connected story to consider.A statement of evidence
as to facts should commence by recording the place, date and time (if
material), to which the evidence refers.(ii)Ensure that only such evidence as
is admissible in law is adduced; particularly eliminate all irrelevant and
hearsay statements.(iii)Avoid attempting to tell the story of the crime by
recording conversations at which the accused was not present.(iv)Ascertain
that any document intended to be produced is legally admissible in evidence.
Every document intended to be produced to the Court must be produced by a
witness and described and, where necessary, identified by a witness, who is
liable to do so.For example, where a document has been acknowledged as correct
or signed by an accused, evidence must be given to show that he has
acknowledged it or his signature must be identified.Mark and number documents
according to order of production.(v)Arrange for the preparation, production
and proof of plans where necessary.(vi)Record the evidence of witnesses as
nearly as possible in their own words and expressions. When evidence is not
given in English, it will be interpreted and recorded in English.(vii)If the
accused has to any person or at any time said anything by way of explanations
or admission of any of the facts in issue, consider the circumstances in which
the statement was made and if it is admissible let a witness be called to
prove it.(viii)Remember that, when it is proposed to tender evidence of an
admission or confession, it is desirable that evidence should first be adduced
by the prosecution of the, circumstances in which it was made to show that it
was voluntary, though under the law the onus lies upon the accused of showing
that a confession made by him was not voluntary.(ix)With regard to the
attendance of witnesses, take advantage where desirable of the provisions of
Army Rule 23(5). The written statements of such witness must be signed and
certified as required by the said rule.(x)Remember that a civilian witness,
can be compelled to attend the taking of the summary [Army Act, sections 135
and 136 and Army Rule 23(6)].(xi)At the close of the evidence of each witness
who is not cross-examined by the accused, make a note that "accused declines
to cross-examine" [Army Rule 23(2)].(xii)Ensure that the evidence of each
witness is signed by the witness [Army Rule 23(3)].(xiii)Ensure that the
record of any statement made by the accused is prefaced by a note that he was
formally "cautioned" [Army Rule 23(3)].(xiv)Enter at the end of the summary of
evidence a statement that the requirements Army Rule 23(1), (2), (3) and (4)
have been complied with, and sign the summary. The place and date should be
stated.

### 2\. Evidence in special cases,--

(a)Where the charge is for deficiency of kit, unless IAFD 918 is to be
produced in evidence, the fact that the accused has been at some time
previously in possession of a complete kit, or of the articles alleged to be
deficient, the date and place of discovering any subsequent deficiencies, and
that none of the articles have since been recovered, should be included in the
summary of evidence. Any articles recovered will be omitted from the
charge.(b)Where a certified true copy of a record of any Regimental book is to
be produced [Army Act, section 142(4)], the copy should show clearly that the
record purports to have been signed by the CO or by the officer whose duty it
was to make the record [Army Act, section 142(3)].(c)Where the charge is for
neglecting to ob 'y a battalion or similar order, the order should be proved
as provided in Army Act, section 142(3) or (4) [See (b) above], but if the
order is not included in the "regimental books" (Regulations Army, para. 610],
as for example a station or a company order or an order for sentries, the
original order must be produced.(d)Where IAFD-918 is to be produced, it must
be signed by the officer having the custody of the books from which it is
complied. The original declaration of the Court of inquiry, even if in
existence, is not admissible in evidence. Nor is IAFD-918, unless the entry in
the Court-Martial book (of which it is a certified copy) purports to have been
signed by the officer in actual command of the accused's corps or department,
as required by Army Act, section 106.(e)A certificate of surrender or
apprehension under Army Act, section 142(6) (IAFD-910) or under Army Act,
section 142(5) should only state the fact, date and place of the surrender or
apprehension of the absentee and the manner in which he was dressed and is
only admissible as evidence of those facts and only in cases of desertion or
absence without leave. The circumstances of the surrender or apprehension must
be proved by a witness. The certificate must be signed by a police officer not
below the rank of an officer in charge of a police station. For the
surrender/apprehension certificate under Army Act, section 142(5), See Army
Regulations, para. 378.The CO of the deserter or absentee should forward
IAFD-910 without unnecessary delay to the officer in charge of the police
station for completion and signatures.(f)Many cases depend on the
identification of persons or things. Evidence should be recorded to show that
each witness identifies the accused, and any other person or thing mentioned
in his evidence whose identity is relevant to the charge, e.g., on a charge
for theft, the articles, the subject to the charge, must be produced and
identified or their absence satisfactorily accounted for.Articles alleged to
have been damaged should be produced and identified.(g)Where the charge is for
any offence which has occasioned any expense, loss, damage or destruction for
which it is expedient to award stoppages under Army Act, section 71(1), values
should be assessed and evidence taken as follows :-(i)When an article which
has an official value has been lost or rendered unserviceable, a witness is
required who can prove the value (inclusive of authorised departmental
expenses) of the article at the date of loss upon a basis of its age and/or
condition and by reference to the regulations which should be produced for
fixing the value of the article at that age or in-that condition.(ii)When the
article has an official value competent evidence is required to prove the
approximate value.(iii)When an article has been damaged but not rendered
unserviceable, competent evidence is required to prove the pecuniary amount of
the damage, which will be either the cost of repairing it, if it can be
repaired, or the loss of value caused by the act of the accused, if it cannot
be repaired, or the cost of repair plus any ultimate loss of value due to the
act of the accused.(iv)In the case of absence or desertion, the deficiencies
to be alleged in a charge under Army Act, section 54(b) are those ascertained
when the soldier rejoins, not necessarily those found on the commencement of
the absence, or by a Court of inquiry.Evidence should not be taken of the
values of personal clothing and necessaries the property of a person subject
to Army Act the value of which has not to be made good to the public.(h)Where
the charge is for misappropriation or losing by neglect money or stores, etc.,
the evidence should show--(i)The period during which the accused held office
and was responsible for certain money or stores, etc.;(ii)That at the opening
of this period the accounts, money, stores, etc., were correct;(iii)Receipts
and expenditures of money, stores, etc., during this period;(iv)That at the
close of this period there was a specific deficiency of money, stores,
etc.,items (ii), (iii), (iv) must, as a rule, be proved by the production by a
witness of the original account books, and vouchers, and evidence that they
were kept or signed by the accused. Witnesses should then give evidence
explaining the deficiency, which is checked with the original books, etc., and
recorded.(i)In cases of attempts to commit suicide, medical evidence giving an
opinion on the state of mind of the accused at the time of the commission of
the alleged offence should be to ken.(j)In cases of self-maiming the medical
witness or witnesses should be asked whether the injury sustained by the
accused will render him unfit for further service.

### 3\. Where the accusation arises out of complaint made by an individual who
has not yet identified the person whose conduct is complained of, the
complainant, and any other alleged eye-witness in the same circumstances,
should have an opportunity of picking out from a group the person against whom
they are prepared to give evidence. For this purpose an identification parade
should be held in the presence of an officer before the witness(es) give
evidence at the summary, or otherwise see the accused in circumstances which
may suggest that they are expected to recognise one particular person as the
offender. At such parade a witness should not be permitted to see or hear
anything which might induce him to take a cue from the behaviour of another
witness. Army Regulations, para. 406 refers.

### 4\. If in any case two or more persons are suspected of complicity in an
offence, and it is found necessary to call one of these as a witness for the
prosecution against the other or others charged in connection with the
offence, one of two courses must be taken either--

(a)proceedings against him must be abandoned and any charge therein already
preferred against him dismissed; or(b)steps must be taken to ensure that the
case against him is disposed of summarily or tried by Court-Martial, before
the trial of persons concerned against whom he is to give evidence; and that
he is, only tendered as a witness when he has already been acquitted or
convicted.In all such cases the circumstances and the course proposed should
be fully set out in a covering letter to the convening officer.COMMANDING
OFFICER

### 5\. A CO will take care that an accused person is not detained in custody
beyond 48 hours without the charge, being investigated, unless investigation
is impracticable, in which case a report will be made to the officer to whom
application to convene a GCM or DGM would be made (Army Act, section 102).

### 6\. Before applying for the trial of an offender a CO should satisfy
himself--

(a)That the accused is subject to the Army Act, and is charged with an offence
which is an offence against that Act;(b)That the offender is not exempt from
trial under the provisions of Army Act, section 122;(c)That the offence is not
one which he should dispose of himself summarily or one which he should and
can try by SCM (Army Regulations, para. 447) without reference [Army Act,
section 120(2)] or, if it is one of those offences, that from its gravity, or
from the previous character of the accused, he ought not to deal with it on
account of the inadequacy of his powers of punishment;(d)That the summary of
evidence is properly recorded (see paras. I and 2 ante);(e)That the evidence
justifies the trial of the offender on the charge;(f)That the charge is
properly framed under appropriate section (see Army Rules 28 to 30).(g)That an
officer has given the accused a copy of the summary (or abstract) of evidence
as soon as practicable after he had been remanded for trial and that his right
as to preparing his defence and of being assigned or represented at the trial
have been explained to him by that officer [Army Rule 33(7)].

### 7\. When making application for the trial of the offender the CO should
satisfy himself that the following provisions are complied with:

(a)The application for trial (IAFD-937) (must be accompanied by all necessary
documents as therein specified; and the medical officer's certificate at the
foot completed;(b)The convening officer must be informed whether or not the
accused desires to have a defending officer assigned to represent him at the
trial;(c)The information required as to officers who have investigated the
case; or sat on a Court of inquiry, must be given with great care;(d)The
charge-sheet must be signed by the officer in actual command of the unit to
which the accused belongs or is attached and should state the place and date
of signature;(e)Sufficient space be left at the foot of the charge-sheet for
the orders of convening officer, or officer sanctioning trial under Army Act,
section 120(2), to be entered. The place and date should be entered by the
officer signing such orders;(j)The section of the Army Act under each charge
is framed should be entered in the margin, opposite the charge to which it
refers;(g)When it is intended to prove any facts in respect of which any
deduction from the pay and allowances (i.e., stoppages) of the accused can be
awarded in consequence of the offence charged, those facts must be clearly
shown in the particulars of the charge and the sum of the loss or damage it is
intended to charge [see para. 2(g) above];(h)IAFD-905 by whomsoever produced,
is to be signed by the officer having custody of the books from which it is
complied; custody includes temporary custody for the purpose of the trial. In
preparing this form, minor offences may be grouped as "miscellaneous" offences
of the same class as that being charged should be shown in a separate group.

### 8\. After trial has been ordered the CO should satisfy himself that the
following provisions are complied with :-

(a)The accused be warned for trial not less than 96 hours (24 hours where he
is on active service) before the Court assembles, must be informed by an
officer of every charge on which he is to be tried, must be given a copy of
the charge-sheet and a vernacular translation of the same and of the summary
(or abstract) or evidence, and notice of the intention to call witnesses whose
evidence is not contained in the summary (or abstract) and an abstract of
their evidence, and must be informed of the ranks, names and units of he
officers who are to form the Court as well as of any waiting members (Army
Rule 34).(b)The accused must be informed that on his giving the names of any
witnesses for the defence, reasonable steps will be taken to procure their
attendance;(c)The accused must be afforded proper opportunity for preparing
his defence;(d)The CO must not detail as a member of the Court an officer who
is ineligible or disqualified to serve tinder the provisions of Army Rule
39;(e)The accused must be seen by a medical officer on the morning of each day
the Court is sitting for his trial and the medical officer's report should be
produced by the prosecutor to the Court immediately after it opens;(J)In a
case of a joint trial, the accused persons should be informed of the intention
to try them together and of their right under Army Rule 35(4) to claim
separate trials if the nature of the charge admits of it.

### 9\. After confirmation (or refusal thereof), the CO must see that the
following provisions are complied with:

(a)The proceedings must be promulgated as laid down in Army Regulations, para.
472;(b)The record of the promulgation must be entered on the proceedings in
form shown on page .................and, if the proceedings have been
confirmed, extracts recorded in the Regimental books;(c)After promulgation the
proceedings must be forwarded without delay to DJAG of the Command direct.
Army Regulations, para. 477 refers.CONVENING OFFICER

### 10\. The convening c,fficer should satisfy himself as regards the matters
mentioned in paras. 6 and 7 (above); and in addition he will ensure :-

(a)In all cases for trial by GCM, and in all cases of indecency, fraud, theft
(except ordinary theft), and civil offences; and in all other cases which
present doubt or difficulty, that the charge-sheet and summary (or abstract)
of evidence are submitted to the Deputy or Assistant Judge-Advocate-General
concerned before trial is ordered (See Army Regulations, para. 458);(b)That he
holds the necessary Court-Martial warrant empowering him to convene the
description of Court-Martial that he considers appropriate;(c)That the Court
which he has decided to convene is properly composed in accordance with the
Army Act: See also Army Rule 40-any opinion of the convening officer with
respect to the composition of the Court under the said rule should be stated
in the convening order;(d)That no officer is detailed to serve on the Court
who is ineligible or disqualified under Army Rule 39;Note.-In the case of
theft from an officers' mess, all the officers of that mess are regarded as
interested, and are therefore disqualified.(e)That application is made to the
Deputy or Assistant Judge-Advocate-General concerned for the service of a JA
when the appointment of a JA is legally required or is desirable (See Army
Act, section 129);(f)That the No., Rank, Name and unit of each officer
detailed to serve are stated in the convening order correctly;(g)That in
trials by GCM and in complicated cases a prosecutor is specially selected for
his experience and knowledge of military law;(h)That the order for trial at
the foot of charge-sheet is signed by him, or by an officer of his staff
signing "for" him;(i)That the convening order is signed by him, or by a staff
officer authorised by custom and usage of the service to sign his orders or by
the staff officer, as such.

### 11\. Where the convening officer, or the senior officer, on the spot
considers that military exigencies or the necessities of discipline render it
impossible or inexpedient to observe any of the rules referred to in Army Rule
36, he must make on IAFD-920 a declaration to that effect specifying the
nature of those exigencies or necessities.

### 12\. The convening officer must ascertain whether the accused desires to
have a defending officer assigned to assist him at his trial, and if so, must
endeavour to meet his wishes. Should no suitable officer be available, the
convening officer must notify the presiding officer in writing [See Army Rule
95(2)].

### 13\. The convening officer must send to the senior member of the Court-
Martial the convening order and charge-sheet and, where no JA has been
appointed with a copy of the summary (or abstract) of evidence. He should also
send, to all the other members, copies of the charge-sheet and to the JA when
one has been appointed, a copy each of the charge-sheet, convening order and
summary (or abstract) of evidence. Army Rule 37(4) refer. Except in the case
of joint trial of two or more persons a separate copy of the convening order
should be supplied in respect of every person to be tried.

GENERAL

### 14\. The original convening order must be before the Court and the
presiding officer must satisfy himself that the Court is duly constituted
according to its terms. The Court must not make any alteration or correction
in the convening order, nor, save as allowed by Army Rule 50(1) in the charge-
sheet.

### 15\. In any case of doubts as to constitution of the Court, or any other
matter affecting jurisdiction of the Court or validity of the charges the
presiding officer should consult the convening officer before the Court
assembles, or if the Court has assembled, before proceeding with the trial.

### 16\. When, in accordance with Army Rule 89, the Court is sworn/affirmed at
one time in the presence of several accused persons who are to be tried
separately. In succession the time at which the convening order is read should
be recorded on page "A" of each IAFD-906, as the time at which the trial of
each of the accused commences.

In such cases it is desirable that the time of arraignment of each such
accused should be inserted on page "B" of each IAFD-906 before the words: "The
accused is arraigned", etc.

### 17\. The full name and description of the accused should be entered on the
first page of the proceedings.

### 18\. Care should be taken that, whenever a Court of inquiry has been held,
the relevant certificate (on the first page of the proceedings) is properly
completed.

### 19\. Any person addressing the Court or examining or cross-examining a
witness, should always do so standing.

### 20\. Every witness, including the officer, producing IAFD-905 must be
sworn or affirmed in the presence of the accused to whom his evidence refers;
he must not be examined on a former oath taken in the presence of another
accused person.

The prosecutor or other person producing documents must be sworn/affirmed. By
the custom of Court-Martial, however, the accused is allowed to hand in
letters and certificate of character purporting to be in the handwriting of
absent officer of former employers, and unless there is reason to doubt their
authenticity, they may be accepted.

### 21\. The evidence will usually be taken down in narrative form. Questions
and answers recorded verbatim will be numbered consecutively ("Q 1 ", "A 1",
etc.), throughout.

### 22\. When original documents are not retained by the Court and copies are
attached to the proceedings, it must be stated in the proceedings that the
copies have been compared with the originals and found to be correct. As a
rule, it is preferable to attach copies and not original documents, to the
proceedings.

### 23\. In accepting IAFs D-905, D-918, D-910 and certified copies or records
in regimental books, attention should be given in para. 7(i), 2(d), (e) and
(b) ante, respectively. Where these documents are given in evidence it is
sufficient to record upon the proceedings the mere fact of their production
without setting out the facts, which they purport to prove; but the record of
evidence should always show that witness identified the accused as the person
to whom the particular document relates.

### 24\. A certified true copy of a record in a regimental book (e.g., on
IAFD-918 of an entry in the Court-Martial book) is sufficient evidence
thereof; it is not necessary for the Court to compare the copy with the
regimental book.

### 25. Where the value of arms, ammunition, equipment or public clothing lost
or damaged is proved, the accused if convicted should be sentenced to be put
under stoppages, notwithstanding the fact that he may also be sentenced to be
dismissed from the service, in case the latter part of the sentence should be
remitted.

### 26\. Arrears of pay and allowances forfeited by sentence of Court-Martial
under Army Act, section 71(k) cannot be applied as compensation for loss or
damage. If, therefore, loss or damage has been averred and proved, stoppages
should be awarded, even if the accused is also sentenced to forfeiture of
arrears, so that compensation may first be paid and any balance remaining over
forfeited.

### 27\. Included in IAFD-906 are two sets of pages "C" and "D"-one for
proceedings on a plea of "Not guilty" and one for proceedings on a plea of
"guilty". Where the pleas recorded are all "Not guilty" or all "guilty", the
set pertaining to the plea or pleas recorded is alone to be used, and the
unused set should be removed from the proceedings.

When some of the pleas are "Not guilty" and some "guilty", both sets will be
used, the Court proceedings first on the plea or pleas of "Not guilty" up to
and including the findings, and then on the plea or please of "Guilty". It is
not necessary to insert before page "D" a separate sheet containing the
findings of the Court upon the plea or pleas of "Not guilty".

### 28\. Where two or more persons are charged and tried jointly on a charge-
sheet, only one set of proceedings should normally be used, the relevant pages
of IAFD-906 being adopted accordingly, and the replies of each of the accused
to the questions set out therein being separately recorded. A separate sheet,
however, should be used for the finding and proceeding on conviction, and for
the sentence in each case.

### 29\. Where trial proceeds on more than one charge-sheet, all printed
matter on page "A" and the two printed lines at the top of page "B" should be
struck out in the case of the second or any subsequent charge-sheet, the word
"second", "third" (or as the case may be) being inserted before the word
"chargq-sheet" on page "B".

### 30\. The charge-sheet is to be inserted in the proceedings after page "B"
and marked as "B 2". All other documents are to be attached at the end of the
proceedings in the order of their production to the Court.

### 31\. Every document attached to the proceedings should be signed by a
presiding officer (or JA) and marked with a reference letter, preferably not
one used in IAFD-906.

### 32\. In case of a plea of "guilty" the summary of evidence is to be
annexed to the proceedings. In case of a plea of "Not guilty", it will be
annexed if it or any part of it has been put in evidence at the trial. In
other cases the summary will merely be enclosed with the proceedings when sent
to the confirming officer.

### 33\. All erasures of written or printed matter, and all interlineations
and corrections should be initialled by the presiding officer or JA.

### 34\. Pages should be numbered consecutively or to the end of the
proceedings after they have been put together in the order prescribed. In case
of revision, the latter proceedings are added at the end, and the number of
pages carried on.

### 35\. Care must be taken that the proceedings are both signed and dated by
the presiding officer and the JA (if any). Army Rule 67(2) refers.

DUTIES OF PROSECUTOR

### 36\. For the general duties of a prosecutor. See Army Rule 77(1).

### 37\. Duties before trial-The prosecutor should have previous knowledge of
the subject-matter of the charge or charges. For that reason the officer
detailed as prosecutor must make it his business to acquaint himself with the
circumstances, and assure himself that the various rules relating to procedure
before trial have been complied with. He will, as a rule, be the officer who
recorded the summary of evidence. The Court will look to him for an
explanation of any defect or omission apparent or alleged by the accused.

On being detailed for duty he should--(a)Obtain a copy of the charge-sheet and
summary of evidence, and enquire whether there is any correspondence or other
material relative to the case, which he should peruse and note.(b)If he thinks
there is any legal defect, irregularity or serious omission in either the
charge-sheet or the summary of evidence, he should refer to the CO of the
accused's unit.The ability to detect irregularities connotes a working
knowledge of the Army Rule 1954, and of the laws of evidence.(c)Satisfy
himself that Army Rules 33 and 34 and in the case of joint trial Army Rule 35,
have been complied with.(d)Satisfy himself that proper steps are being taken
to secure the attendance of all necessary witnesses.(e)Obtain or repair a
record of the accused's service (IAFD-905) for production at the trial if
required. This form must be signed by the officer having the custody of the
Regimental book.(f)Consider whether an opening address is desirable, or is
likely to be required from him by the Court [Army Rule 56(3)1. If so, prepare
such an opening address, setting out in the form of a narrative the facts
which are alleged against the accused, and the nature of the evidence by which
those facts are to be proved. The opening address must be as impartial as he
can make it, free from unnecessary comment, denunciation or prejudice. There
must be no reference in it to any allegation which is not to be proved in
evidence subsequently at the trial. An opening address is not ordinarily
required in disciplinary cases of a simple nature, but is valuable where
accounts are involved or the evidence is largely circumstantial.(g)On the
morning of the trial, take with him to the Court a certificate by a medical
officer stating that he has examined the accused on that morning and, that he
is fit for trial.(h)Assure himself that all witnesses and necessary exhibits
are present.

### 38\. Duties at the trial--

(a)On the opening of the Court the prosecutor presents the medical certificate
to the presiding officer.(b)If any material witness is absent, the prosecutor
should inform the Court at once, and if necessary, apply for an adjournment
[Army Rule 138].(c)If a Court of inquiry has been held respecting a matter
upon which a charge against the accused is founded, the prosecutor should hand
to the Court a list of the names of the officers who sat on the Court of
inquiry. The written record of the proceedings of such Court of inquiry must
be laid before the Court-Martial [Army Rule 41].(d)As to the prosecutor's
right to address the Court and call witnesses in reply in the event of a
special plea or plea in bar of trial. See Army Rules 49,51 and 53.(e)Where the
accused pleads "guilty", the duties of the prosecutor are confined to calling
such witnesses as may be necessary if the summary be insufficient [Army Rule
54(3)] and producing IAFD-905.Note.-If the accused in a statement with
reference to the charge or in mitigation says something which is inconsistent
with his plea, the prosecutor should call the attention of the Court to Army
Rule 54(5), and prepare to call his witnesses as on a plea of "Not
guilty".(f)where the accused pleads "Not guilty", the prosecutor makes his
opening address, if any, and if it is in writing hands it in and calls his
first witness.(g)Before calling his witnesses, and as the case proceeds, the
prosecutor must consider whether he should call all those whose evidence is in
the summary (or abstract) of evidence, and whether it is the duty to call as a
witness any person whose evidence is not contained in summary [Army Rules 134
and 135].(h)As to accomplices as witnesses for the prosecution. See para. 4
ante.(i)After a witness for the prosecution has been sworn or affirmed, the
prosecutor will ascertain the witness's No., Rank, Name, Unit, station,
address, occupation, etc., as may be material and will elicit from the witness
the relevant facts to which the witness can speak. This may be done by means
of questions of a non-leading character or by permitting the witness to tell
his own story, questions being subsequently asked to make good any omissions.
A series of short simple questions will generally assist the witness to
recount facts in chronological order, and the presiding officer or JA in
making the record.(j)It may happen that a question in cross-examination has
been so framed as to compel the witness to answer simply "Yes" or "No",
whereas there is within the prosecutor's knowledge an explanation which should
in fairness be made. In such a case the prosecutor may in re-examination refer
the witness to that question and answer, and ask him if he has anything to add
or explain.The prosecutor should not dismiss a witness until he has
ascertained whether the Court desires to question him and until Army Rule
141(2), (3), (4) has been complied with.(k)The prosecutor must take care that
each exhibit which he desires to put before the Court is produced and
identified by one of his witnesses. If an exhibit (e.g., the property in
respect of which theft is alleged to have been committed) is to be referred to
by more than one witnesses, each witness who refers to it must be invited to
look at the exhibit, and say whether he identifies it. If the prosecutor is
himself producing documents he should do so, after being sworn or affirmed as
a witness, before he calls his other witnesses [Army Rule 56(5)]. Neither the
prosecutor nor a witness may refer to the contents of a document which is not
before'the Court, unless evidence is given accounting for its absence.(l)The
prosecutor having called his witnesses the case for the prosecution is closed.
The subsequent procedure depends upon the exercise by the accused of his
rights and is fully set out in Army Rules 58 and 59.(m)If the accused calls
any witnesses to the facts, it is the duty of the prosecutor to assist the
Court to test the value of their evidence by cross-examination. The result of
omission to cross-examine is frequently that the evidence for the defence
stands unchallenged, and the prosecutor cannot properly, in a subsequent
address, characterise as untrue a defence which he has not attempted, by
question to the witnesses at the proper time, to impugn cross-examination is
not limited to the matters dealt with in the examination-in-chief. It must,
however, be confirming to matters relevant, directly or indirectly, to the
issue. Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination, but not questions
which assume that facts have been given in evidence which have not been given.
As to calling witnesses in reply to the defence. See Army Rule 143.(n)The
desirability of making-a closing address at the appropriate time as provided
in Army Rules 58 and 59, it is a matter for the prosecutor's discretion. If
there is any evidence or argument put forward by the defence which he thinks
might seriously mislead the Court, he should comment on it. He is entitled to
sum up the evidence generally and to point out any weakness in the defence,
and to suggest the inference which the Court may draw from the fact which has
not been proved in evidence.(o)If the accused is convicted on any charge, the
prosecutor or some other person in a position to do so, is sworn or affirmed
(if he has not already been sworn or affirmed as a witness in the case) and
produces evidence (IAFD-905) of the character, age, service, rank, etc., of
the accused.DUTIES OF DEFENDING OFFICER

### 39\. Duties before trial--

(a)The defending officer, like the prosecutor requires a working knowledge of
the Army Rules, 1954 and of the laws of evidence. He must also make himself
acquainted with the detail's of the case.(b)The proper preparation of the
defence.(i)Study of the charge-sheet and summary of evidence and consideration
of legal points which he may raise, or which may arise upon them, e.g.,
objection to a charge, plea to the jurisdiction, plea in bar of trial,
admissibility of a confession or of other evidence.(ii)Ascertaining from the
accused what is his answer, if any, to each charge.(iii)Communication with
possible witnesses for the defence, to ascertain if they are able to give
evidence in support of the accused's case, and the taking of appropriate steps
to secure their attendance at the trial [Army Rules 34(1) and 136].Note.-He is
not entitled to interview witnesses for the prosecution without special
authority.(c)The defending officer must bear in mind that the ultimate
responsibility for the decision on the plea which is to be offered or each
charge must rest upon the accused himself. He may properly advise on this
point, but should put no pressure on the accused, except to dissuade him from
pleading guilty, where he appears to have an answer, however, slight, to the
charge. The defending officer's duty at the trial will be to present the
accused's defence in the best possible manner. He may properly prepare
arguments on fact of law, which his own reason of ingenuity may suggest, but
it would be improper for him to advise or suggest to the accused on account of
the facts, other than that which the accused himself desires to give.(d)The
defending officer is not called upon to judge the truth or otherwise of the
accused's defence, nor is he permitted to express his own opinion or belief
[Army Rule 100]. To avoid, however, giving countenance to a line of defence
which is incompatible with his duty as an officer, he should apply through his
CO to the convening officer for permission to withdraw from the case.

### 40\. Duties at the trial--

(a)Having the rights, duties and obligations of counsel, the defending officer
must himself conduct the case as representing the accused, i.e., he will
himself cross-examine witness for the defence, take any objections, make any
submissions, and address the Court on the accused's behalf.(b)The defending
officer has the right to make an application for adjournment [Army Rule 34(4)]
and to address the Court in support of it. It should not be made on the ground
of technical irregularity or omission, merely as a protest, where no benefit
can accrue to the presentation of the defence from the postponement of the
trial.(c)It is the defending officer's duty to question each witness for the
prosecution on any matter which is to be alleged in defence insofar as this
matter is or should be within the witness's knowledge. As to injurious
question, see para. 110.(d)The defending officer may take objection to any
question put by the prosecutor to a witness for the prosecution on one of the
following grounds; the objection should be made if possible before the witness
answers [Army Rule 141(1)] :(i)That it is a leading question.(ii)That is
invites hearsay, or on account of an involuntary confession, or evidence of
the accused's bad character when that character has not been put in issue,
etc.(e)At the close of the case for the prosecution, the defending officer may
submit that the accused has no case to answer, and therefore should not be
called upon for his defence, because, the prosecution have not produced
evidence in support of one or more essentials in the charge [Army Rule
57].Note.-This submission must be to the effect that there is no evidence at
all on the point or points, and not that the evidence is
untrustworthy.(f)Where a witness not examined at the summary of evidences is
called by the prosecutor, the defending officer may apply for any adjournment,
or post-ponement of cross-examination [Army Rule 135].(g)The defending officer
is entitled to consult the JA, if one has been appointed, on any question of
law or procedure relative to the charge or trial [Army Rule 105(1)].(h)The
defending officer must throughout the proceedings, treat the Court with
respect and condour.APPENDIX IV
