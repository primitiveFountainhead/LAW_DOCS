Note: The table above indicates the commuted value of pension expressed as
number of year's purchase with reference to the age of pensioner as on his
next birthday. The commuted value in case of an employee retiring at the age
of 58 years is 10.46 year's purchase and, therefore, if he commutes Rs. 100/-
from his pension within one year of retirement, the lump-sum amount payable to
him works out to Rs. 100 x 10.46 x 12 = Rs. 12,552/-
