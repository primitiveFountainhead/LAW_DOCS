to 22.[3][The Constitution (Ninety-second Amendment) Act, 2003, was an attempt
toward providing national recognition to four languages, namely- Bodo, Dogri,
Maithili, and Santhali. To achieve this, the 8th Schedule of the Indian
Constitution had to be revised. Four of these languages were added to the
existing list of languages recognized as official languages. With this
addition, the list now held 22 constitutionally recognized languages. It gave
minority languages the identity of an officially recognized language in the
Constitution. This step was noteworthy as it helped to safeguard not just the
primitive and native languages but also the interests of the speakers of the
language.Also Refer]
