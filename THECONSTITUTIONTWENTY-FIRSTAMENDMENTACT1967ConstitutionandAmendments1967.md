**_Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Twenty-
second Amendment) Bill, 1966 (Bill No. XXIV of 1966) which was enacted as THE
CONSTITUTION (Twenty-first Amendment) Act, 1967_****STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND
REASONS** There have been persistent demands from the Sindhi-speaking people
for the inclusion of the Sindhi language in the Eighth Schedule to the
Constitution. Although at present Sindhi is not a regional language in a well-
defined area, it used to be the language of a province of the undivided India
and, but for partition, would have continued to be so. The Commissioner for
Linguistic Minorities has also recommended the inclusion of Sindhi in the
Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. On 4th November, 1966, it was announced
that Government had decided to include the Sindhi language in the Eighth
Schedule to the Constitution. The Bill seeks to give effect to this
decision.An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.BE it enacted by
Parliament in the Eighteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-

### 1. Short title. -

This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-first Amendment) Act, 1967.

numbered as entries 13 to 15 respectively, and(b)before entry "13" as so re-
numbered, the entry "12. Sindhi." shall be inserted.[The Constitution (Twenty-
First Amendment) Act, 1967, added the Sindhi language to the Eighth Schedule

bringing the overall number of languages on the 8th schedule to fifteen. It

eighth schedule of the Indian Constitution lists the official languages of the
Republic of India. The languages were qualified for representation in the
