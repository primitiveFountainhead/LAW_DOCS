**_Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Ninty First
Amendment) Bill, 2000 which was enacted as the Constitution (Eighty Fourth
Amendment) Act, 2002._****STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS** Provisos to
articles 82 and 170 (3) of the Constitution provide that no fresh readjustment
of constituencies can be undertaken until the figures of the first census
taken after the year 2000 are published. These provisos were inserted by the
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 as a measure to boost family
planning norms. Since the first census to be taken after the year 2000 has
already begun, the constitutional embargo on undertaking fresh delimitation
will lapse as soon as the figures of this census are published.

### 2. There have been consistent demands, both for and against undertaking
the exercise of fresh delimitation. Keeping in view the progress of family
planning programmes in different parts of the country, the Government, as part
of the National Population Policy strategy, recently decided to extend the
current freeze on undertaking fresh delimitation up to the year 2026 as a
motivational measure to enable the State Government to pursue the agenda for
population stabilisation.

### 3. Government has also decided to undertake readjustment and
rationalization of territorial constituencies in the States, without altering
the number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and
Legislative Assemblies of the States, including the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes constituencies, on the basis of the population ascertained at
the census for the year 1991, so as to remove the imbalance caused due to
uneven growth of population/electorate in different constituencies.

### 4. It is also proposed to refix the number of seats reserved for the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People and the
Legislative Assemblies of the States on the basis of the population
ascertained at the census for the year 1991.

[The Constitution (Eighty-fourth Amendment) Act, 2002, extended the bar on the
adjustment of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative assemblies for the
next 25 years with the same goal of supporting population control measures.
This meant that the 1971 national census population data for the statewide
distribution of parliamentary seats would be extended. This will lead to the
freezing or delimitation of Lok Sabha and State Assembly seats up till the
first Census after 2026. The number of Lok Sabha seats and State Assembly
seats is based on the 1971 Census, while the current boundaries are based on
the 2001 Census. This means that the Lok Sabha and assembly seats will be
constant till the year 2026. Additionally, it demanded that territorial seats
in the states be adjusted and rationalized in light of population figures from
the 1991 census.Also Refer]
