An Act further to amend the Constitution of IndiaBe it enacted by Parliament
in the Sixty-fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows-Declared
unconstitutional by Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India,
2015 SCC OnLine SC 964.

### 1. Received the assent of the President on December 31, 2014 and published
in the Gazette of India, Extra., Part II, Section 1, dated 31st December,
2014, pp. 1-3, No. 49.

Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Judges of the Supreme Court are
appointed under clause (2) of Article 124 and the Judges of the High Courts
are appointed under clause (1) of Article 217 of the Constitution, by the
President. The Ad-hoc Judges and retired Judges for the Supreme Court are
appointed under clause (1) of Article 127 and Article 128 of the Constitution
respectively. The appointment of Additional Judges and Acting Judges for the
High Court is made under Article 224 and the appointment of retired Judges for
sittings of the High Courts is made under Article 224-A of the Constitution.
The transfer of Judges from one High Court to another High Court is made by
the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India under clause
(1) of Article 222 of the Constitution.

### 2. The Supreme Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union
of India, (1998) 7 SCC 739

, had interpreted clause (2) of Article 124 and clause (1) of Article 217 of
the Constitution with respect to the meaning of "consultation" as
"concurrence". Consequently, a Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of
Judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts was formulated, and is being
followed for appointment.

### 3. After review of the relevant constitutional provisions, the
pronouncements of the Supreme Court and consultations with eminent Jurists, it
is felt that a broad based National Judicial Appointments Commission should be
established for making recommendations for appointment of Judges of the
Supreme Court and High Courts. The said Commission would provide a meaningful
role to the judiciary, the executive and eminent persons to present their view
points and make the participants accountable, while also introducing
transparency in the selection process.

### 4. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment) Bill, 2014 is
an enabling constitutional amendment for amending relevant provisions of the
Constitution and for setting up a National Judicial Appointments Commission.
The proposed Bill seeks to insert new Articles 124-A, 124-B and 124-C after
Article 124 of the Constitution. The said Bill also provides for the
composition and the functions of the proposed National Judicial Appointments
Commission. Further, it provides that Parliament may, by law, regulate the
procedure for appointment of Judges and empower the National Judicial
Appointments Commission to lay down procedure by regulation for the discharge
of its functions, manner of selection of persons for appointment and such
other matters as may be considered necessary.

### 5. The proposed Bill seeks to broad base the method of appointment of
Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts, enables participation of
judiciary, executive and eminent persons and ensures greater transparency,
accountability and objectivity in the appointment of the Judges in the Supreme
Court and High Courts.

### 6. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.
