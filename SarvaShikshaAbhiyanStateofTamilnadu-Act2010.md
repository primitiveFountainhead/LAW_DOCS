Sarva Shiksha AbhiyanFramework for Implementation [Issued by Central
Government for all States]

### 1. Introduction.

\- 1.1 Towards a Right Based Framework1.1.1The role of Universal Elementary
Education (UEE) for strengthening the social fabric of democracy through
provision of equal opportunities to all has been accepted since the inception
of our Republic. The original Article 45 in the Directive Principles of State
Policy in the Constitution mandated the State to endeavour to provide free and
compulsory education to all children up to the age of fourteen within a period
of ten years. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986/92, states:"In our
national perception, education is essentially for all Education has an
acculturation role. It refines sensitivities and perceptions that contribute
to national cohesion, a scientific temper and independence of mind and spirit
- thus furthering the goals of socialism, secularism and democracy enshrined
in our Constitution"1.1.2With the formulation of NPE, India initiated a wide
range of programmes for achieving the goal of UEE. These efforts were
intensified in the 1980s and 1990s through several schematic and programme
interventions, such as Operation Black Board (OBB), Shiksha Karmi Project
(SKP), Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Project (APPEP), Bihar Education
Project (BEP), U.P Basic Education Project (UPBEP), Mahila Samakhya (MS), Lok
Jumbish Project (LJP), and Teacher Education which put in place a
decentralised system of teacher support through District Institutes of
Education and Training, District Primary Education Programme (DPEP). Currently
the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is implemented as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme
in partnership with State Governments for universalising elementary education
across the country.1.1.3Over the years, there has been significant spatial and
numerical expansion of elementary schools in the country. Access and
enrollment at the primary stage of education have reached near universal
levels. The number of out-of-school children has reduced significantly. The
gender gap in elementary education has narrowed and the percentage of children
belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes enrolled is proportionate to their
population. Yet, the goal of universal elementary education continues to elude
us. There remains an unfinished agenda of universal education at the upper
primary stage. The number of children, particularly children from
disadvantaged groups and weaker sections, who drop out of school before
completing upper primary education, remains high. The quality of learning
achievement is not always entirely satisfactory even in the case of children
who complete elementary education.1.1.4The [Constitution (Eighty-sixth
Amendment) Act, 2002] [Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 is at
Annexure 1.] inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide
free and compulsory education to all children of the age group of six to
fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by
law, determine. The [Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE)
Act, 2009] [Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 is at
Annexure 2.], which represents the consequential legislation envisaged under
Article 21-A, means that every child has a right to full time elementary
education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which
satisfies certain essential norms and standards. The need to address
inadequacies in retention, residual access, particularly of un-reached
children, and the questions of quality are the most compelling reasons for the
insertion of Article 21-A in the Constitution of India and the passage of the
RTE Act, 2009 in the Parliament.1.1.5[Article 21-A and the RTE Act came into
effect on 1 April 2010] [Notifications enforcing Article 21-A and the RTE Act
are at Annexures 3(a) and 3(b)]. The title of the RTE Act incorporates the
words 'free and compulsory'. 'free education' means that no child, other than
a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not
supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of
fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and
completing elementary education. 'Compulsory education' casts an obligation on
the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure
admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children
in the 6-14 age group. With this, India has moved forward to a right based
framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments
to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in the Article 21A of
the Constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act.1.2The
Present Context. - 1.2.1 Currently, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is implemented
as India's main programme for universalising elementary education. Its overall
goals include universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social
category gaps in education and enhancement of learning levels of children. SSA
provides for a variety of interventions, including inter alia, opening of new
schools and alternate schooling facilities, construction of schools and
additional classrooms, toilets and drinking water, provisioning for teachers,
periodic teacher training and academic resource support, text books arid
support for learning achievement. These provisions need to be aligned with the
legally mandated norms and standards and free entitlements mandated by the RTE
Act.1.2.2The new law provides a justiciable legal framework that entitles all
children between the age of 6-14 years free and compulsory admission,
attendance and completion of elementary education. It provides for children's
right to an education of equitable quality, based on the principles of equity
and non-discrimination. Most importantly, it provides for children's right to
an education which is free from fear, stress and anxiety.1.3Salient Features
of the RTE Act, 2009. - 1.3.1 The RTE Act, 2009 provides for:(i)The right of
children to free and compulsory education till completion of elementary
education in a neighbourhood school.(ii)It clarifies that 'compulsory
education' means obligation of the appropriate government to provide free
elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and
completion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age'
group. 'Free' means that no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or
charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing
elementary education.(iii)It makes provisions for a non-admitted child to be
admitted to an appropriate class.(iv)It specifies the duties and
responsibilities of appropriate Government, local authority and parents in
providing free and compulsory education, and sharing of financial and other
responsibilities between the Central and State Governments.(v)It lays down the
norms and standards relating inter alia to Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTRs),
buildings and infrastructure, school-working days, teacher-working
hours.(vi)It provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that the
specified pupil teacher ratio is maintained for each school, rather than just
as an average for the State or District or Block, thus ensuring that there is
no urban- rural imbalance in teacher postings. It also provides for
prohibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than
decennial census, elections to local authority, state legislatures and
parliament, and disaster relief.(vii)It provides for appointment of
appropriately trained teachers, i.e. teachers with the requisite entry and
academic qualifications.(viii)It prohibits (a) physical punishment and mental
harassment; (b) screening procedures for admission of children; (c) capitation
fee; (d) private tuition by teachers and (e) running of schools without
recognition,(ix)It provides for development of curriculum in consonance with
the values enshrined in the Constitution, and which would ensure the all-round
development of the child, building on the child's knowledge, potentiality and
talent and making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety through a system
of child friendly and child centred learning.1.4Child Entitlements - the Right
Perspective. - 1.4.1 In the present phase of SSA, it is mandatory to ensure
that the approach and strategies for universalising elementary education are
in conformity with the right perspective mandated under the RTE Act. The RTE
Act provides that 'Every child of the age of 6-14 years shall have a right to
free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school till completion of
elementary education. Free education is defined as 'removal of any financial
barrier by the state that prevents a child from completing eight years of
schooling'. 'Compulsory education' means obligation of the appropriate
government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory
admission, attendance and completion of elementary education to every child in
the six to fourteen age group.In addition to the SSA provisions, most States
are addressing the issue of financial barriers by providing incentives in the
form of uniforms, notebooks, stationary, school bags, scholarships and
transportation facilities, as required. However, the incentive based approach
would need to shift to an entitlement perspective. This paradigm shift needs
to be reflected not only in SSA, but in all interventions, programmes and
schemes for elementary education of the State Governments, as also in the mind
set of all the agencies involved in the implementation of the SSA.1.4.2The
Right perspective under the RTE Act has also brought in new monitoring
mechanisms to ensure that child rights under the Act are protected. The RTE
Act provides for constitutionally created independent bodies like the National
and State Commissions for protection of Child Rights to perform this role.
These bodies, with quasi-judicial powers bringing an element of monitoring new
to the implementation of SSA, requiring that internal monitoring mechanisms
under the SSA engage purposefully with these independent bodies.1.5RTE
Roadmap. - 1.5.1 The RTE provides a legally enforceable right framework with
certain unambiguous time targets that Government must adhere to. For example,
the Act mandates that every child in the six to fourteen age group shall have
a right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school. The Act
also provides that if a school does not exist in an area or limit prescribed-
as the neighbourhood, the appropriate Government and the local authority shall
establish a school in that area within a period of three years. Therefore, all
children - girls and boys - children from disadvantaged groups and
economically weaker sections, children with special needs, children involved
in child labour and so on, must be in a school within three years time
starting from 1 April, 2010. This provision in the RTE Act is applicable to
the SSA goals on access and universalisation of elementary education. The
following time-frames, mandated by the RTE Act, become immediately applicable
to SSA:

Activity | Time Frame  
---|---  
Establishment of neighbourhood schools | 3 years (by 31st March, 2013)  
• Provision of school infrastructure• All weather school buildings• One-classroom-one-teacher• Office cum-store-cum-Head teacher room• Toilets and drinking waterfacilities• Barrier free access• Library• Playground• Fencing/boundary walls 3 years (by31st March, 2013) | 3 years (by 31 March, 2013)  
Provision of teachers as per prescribed PTR | 3 years (by 31st March, 2013)  
Training of untrained teachers | 5 years (by 31st March 2015)  
All quality interventions and other provisions | With immediate effect  
  
1.6Revamp of SSA: The Revised SSA Framework for Implementation. - 1.6.1 SSA
has been operational since 2000-2001. With the passage of the RTE Act, changes
need to be incorporated into the SSA approach, strategies and norms. The
changes are not merely confined to norms for providing teachers or classrooms,
but encompass the vision and approach to elementary education as evidenced in
the shift to child entitlements and quality elementary education in regular
schools.Committee on Implementation of RTE Act and the Resultant Revamp of
SSA. - In September 2009, the Government set up a Committee under the
chairpersonship of Shri Anil Bordia, former Union Education Secretary, to
suggest follow up action on SSA vis-a-vis the RTE Act. The Committee had a
series of interactions with State Education Secretaries, educationists,
representatives of teachers' unions, voluntary organisations and civil society
organisations. The Committee's report, entitled "Implementation of RTE Act and
Resultant Revamp of SSA", submitted in April 2010, was guided by the following
principles:(i)Holistic view of education, as interpreted in the National
Curriculum Framework 2005, with implications for a systemic revamp of the
entire content and process of education with significant implications for
curriculum, teacher education, educational planning and management.(ii)Equity,
to mean not only equal opportunity, but also creation of conditions in which
the disadvantaged sections of the society - children of SC, ST, Muslim
minority, landless agricultural workers and children with special needs, etc.
- can avail of the opportunity.(iii)Access, not to be confined to ensure that
a school becomes accessible to all children within specified distance but
implies an understanding of the educational needs and predicament of the
traditionally excluded categories - the SC, ST and others sections of the most
disadvantaged groups, the Muslim minority, girls in general, and children with
special needs.(iv)Gender concern, implying not only an effort to enable girls
to keep pace with boys but to view education in the perspective spelt out in
the National Policy on Education 1986/92; i.e. a decisive intervention to
bring about a basic change in the status of women.(v)Centrality of teacher, to
motivate them to innovate and create a culture in the classroom, and beyond
the classroom, that might produce an inclusive environment for children,
especially for girls from oppressed and marginalised backgrounds.(vi)Moral
compulsion is imposed through the RTE Act on parents, teachers, educational
administrators and other stakeholders, rather than shifting emphasis on
punitive processes.(vii)Convergent and integrated system of educational
management is pre-requisite for implementation of the RTE law. All states must
move in that direction as speedily as feasible.1.6.2The revised SSA Framework
for Implementation is derived from the recommendations of the Committee on
Implementation of RTE Act and the Resultant Revamp of SSA, and is intended to
demonstrate the harmonization of SSA with the RTE Act. It is also based on
child centric assumptions emerging from the National Policy on Education,
1986/92 and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005. The revised SSA
Framework for Implementation provides abroad out line of approaches and
implementation strategies, within which States can frame more detailed
guidelines keeping in view their specific social, economic and institutional
contexts.1.6.3The revised programmatic and financial norms for SSA
interventions are at Appendix -I

### 2. All Children In School.

\- 2.1 Background2.1.1Universal access to elementary education requires
schooling facilities within reasonable reach of all children. If schools are
not located in or near the habitations where children reside, children are
unlikely to complete schooling, even if they are formally enrolled in schools.
The RTE Act provides children's access to elementary schools within the
defined area or limits of neighbourhood:Section 6. - 'The appropriate
governments and local authorities shall establish, within the area or limits
of a neighbourhood, a school, where it is not already established, within a
period of three years from the commencement of the Act'.2.1.2Further, the Act
places a compulsion on the State to ensure that no child from the weaker
sections or disadvantaged groups is discriminated against in any manner or
prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education.2.1.3A
neighbourhood school is a school located within the defined limits or area of
neighbourhood, which has been notified by the State Government under the State
RTE Rules. The Central Government has notified the area or limits of
neighbourhood to factor in distance norms, with provision for relaxation of
norms in places with difficult terrain where there may be risk of landslides,
floods, lack of roads and in general, danger for young children in the
approach from their homes to the school. In the case of children with
disabilities, the Central RTE Rules provide for appropriate and safe
transportation arrangements to enable them to attend school and complete
elementary education. The neighbourhood norms provided in the Central RTE
Rules would be applicable to Union Territories without Legislature for opening
new schools. In the case of all other States and Union Territories, the
neighbourhood norms notified in the State/UT RTE Rules would be applicable for
opening new schools under SSA.2.2Mapping to Facilitate Children's Access in
Neighbourhood Schools. - 2.2.1 States/UTs need to arrive at a clear picture of
current availability of schools within defined area or limits of
neighbourhoods. This will require mapping of neighbourhoods or habitations and
linking them to specific schools. It is possible that a neighbourhood may be
linked to more than one school. Similarly, a school may be linked to more than
one neighbourhood. A comprehensive exercise will help to identify gaps and
areas where new schools need to be opened.2.2.2Section 12 of the RTE Act
mandates that (a) all Government and local body schools shall provide free and
compulsory education to all children enrolled therein, (b) all aided schools
receiving aid or grants to meet whole or part of its expenses shall provide
free and compulsory education to such proportion of [children as its annual
recurring aid or grants, subject to a minimum of 25%, and (c) all imaided and
'specified category 'schools, namely Kendriya Vidyalaya, Navoday a Vidyalaya,
Sainik schools or any other school having a distinct character as specified by
notification by the State Govemment/UT, shall provide free and compulsory
education to at least 25% children belonging to weaker sections and
disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood] [Guidelines regarding procedurefor
25% admission of children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged
groups from the neighbourhood under section 12(1) (c) and 13(1) of the RTE Act
issued vide Notification No. F.1-15/2010-EE.4 dated 23rd November is at
Annexure 4.]. While determining the need for access of children to
neighbourhood schools, the mapping exercise should factor in the availability
of seats for children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections not only
in Government and local body schools, but also in aided, unaided and special
category schools as provided under the RTE Act.2.3Social Access. - 2.3.1 The
significance of social access in universalising elementary education cannot be
undermined. India is a multi-cultural society of numerous regional and local
cultures. Hierarchies of caste, economic status and gender relations that
characterise Indian society, deeply influence children's access to education.
The accident of birth in a particular religion, class, caste or gender should
not define and restrict a child's life chances for all times to come. It is
important to ensure that the schools respect India's diversity and plurality,
and recognise differences arising out of uneven social and economic
development. If the language of instruction, even in Class I, in a school in a
tribal area is the State language, the child will find the school environment
alienating. If teachers in the school are not sensitised to actively dispel
traditional perceptions regarding gender or caste roles, they are unlikely to
take measures which would help girls, children from disadvantaged groups and
weaker sections pursue education which is equitable and free of anxiety. The
teachers' own patterns of communication with children: the seating
arrangements in the classroom, allocation of work between children reinforce
or dispel societal perceptions about the 'proper' role and place of girls or
children from SC/ST and minority communities. Government schools have a high
proportion of first generation school goers and children from marginalised
communities. Teachers need to be sensitive to the fact that the home
environments of many of these children may not facilitate 'time-dot'
punctuality of children or homework or revision of school work. If these are
perceived as 'lapses' and the child is punished or the school does not help
such children cope with learning, the child is likely to feel discouraged and
drop out of formal schooling. The curriculum and textbooks also need to be
intrinsically connected with the child's life outside the school, and should
reinforce the child's pride in her language, society and way of life, at the
same time affording opportunities for learning about the wider world. Teachers
and educational administrators must be sensitive to these children, and ensure
that, given their difficult circumstances, the children are enabled to
participate in and complete elementary education.2.3.2School access therefore
demands not merely physical access to a neighbourhood school within a notified
distance, but also social access by way of addressing ail exclusionary
practices in the school, especially those based on caste, class, gender and
special needs.2.3.3Mapping for access to neighbourhood schools would need to
go beyond spatial planning and preparation of distance matrices for school
location. The provision of schooling facilities at appropriate locations is an
essential pre-requisite to universal elementary education. But mere provision
of schooling facility is insufficient to ensure that all children attend
school and participate in the learning process. The school may be there, but
children may not attend; they may drop out after a few months; or may be
absent too many days and cannot cope with the learning load. School mapping
exercises will have to incorporate social mapping and should be undertaken
with community involvement, to ensure that all children who cannot access
school for social, cultural and economic reasons, are enabled to do so. School
and social mapping is a powerful means of mobilising the community to ensure
that all children attend schools and complete elementary education. A school
map will help to determine the changes necessary in schools, and build a
dynamic vision of the education services, including infrastructure, teachers,
and equipment, required so that all children, irrespective of their caste,
religion or gender are provided education of reasonable quality.Institutional
flexibility. - An important aspect of planning for universal access that flows
directly from the thrust on a right and equity oriented approach is the need
for creation of capacity within the education system and the school for
addressing the diversified learning needs of different groups of children, who
are now in the school system. The learning needs of children cannot be
compromised because of limitations of the system. Planning and implementation
for universal access in the right based approach would require an
understanding of community needs and circumstances as well as decentralised
decision making for meeting the diversified needs of children.Flexible
academic cycle. - Education of many children is often interrupted because of a
mismatch in the academic calendar and school timings with the life pattern of
the community. The academic calendar may not adequately factor in the
implications of community's economic and social circumstances on children's
-attendance and participation. Centralised decisions mandating uniform
academic calendar and school timings, which do not factor in social and
economic events such as festivals, seasons for sowing, harvesting are among
the main reasons for children's irregular attendance and participation in the
schooling process. There is a need for decentralisation of processes and
procedures in order to address the local specific needs to harmonise the
academic and community calendars.Flexible school timings. - Flexibility of
school timings has two aspects, namely (i) flexibility to accommodate the
local context such as nature of occupations of the community and children's
responsibilities outside the school, in the school timings, and (ii)
flexibility for certain children, whose circumstances may not allow them to
attend school with 'time-dot' punctuality. For example, there are children in
urban areas, who are required to fetch water for their families from a public
facility which may delay their attendance in schools. Similarly, in rural
areas, some children have to fetch water from far off places, collect fire
wood or are engaged in some other activity which may marginally delay their
arrival in school, or some children would require a short break during school
hours to carry lunch for their family members working in the fields. Children
in urban areas who commute a long distance using public transport may get late
for school for reasons beyond their control. There may be children who would
want to leave a little early on Friday for prayers.Mapping for access to
neighbourhood schools.• What is the 'neighbourhood' that the school serves?
Does it serve one or more habitations? Is there more than one school serving
the habitation?• What is the situation of children in the whole area that the
school serves in terms of their enrollment, attendance and retention,
completion of elementary education? Do all children go to school? Are there
children in some habitations and hamlets which form part of the school's
'neighbourhood' who are not accessing school?• Who are the children not going
to school? Are they involved in child labour or domestic chores? Flow can they
be freed of their wage earning and domestic work responsibilities so that they
can attend school?• Are all girls going to school? Are there girls who have
been married off at an early age and are forced to stay at home? Are all
children from SC, ST and Minority communities attending school? Are they
unable to attend school on account of social distance or discrimination? Flow
can the social distance be bridged and the school environment made
discrimination free, so that they can attend school?• Are children with
special needs able to attend school? How can they be facilitated to access
school?• How will we ensure that all children come to school and participate
in the learning process• regularly? How can we create a data base of children
in the catchment area of the 'neighbourhood' school?• Are there children who
require Special Training for appropriate admission to school? How will their
needs be addressed?• What is the availability of teachers, teaching learning
material, library facilities and infrastructure in the school?• What are the
resources available to the school in terms of school grant, teacher grant,
maintenance grant, teaching learning material, scholarships, infrastructure,
drinking water, toilets, mid-day meal, etc? Is this being optimally utilised?•
How can the school benefit from provisions under other schemes, such as
MGNREGA, JNNURM, TSC, DWM, and NRHM?• How will we ensure adequacy of teachers,
teaching learning material, infrastructure and other resources?• How can we
support the school?2.3.4School mapping would include the following steps: (i)
environment building in the village; (ii) conduct of a household survey; (iii)
preparation of a map indicating different households, the number of children
in each household and their participation status in school; (iv) preparation
of a village/ school education register; (v) presentation of the map and
analysis to the people; (vi) preparation of a proposal for improved education
facilities in the village; which would form the basis of the School
Development Plan mandated under the RTE Act.2.4Upgradation of Alternate
Schooling Facilities. - 2.4.1 In the past, SSA has supported alternate
schooling facilities in the form of centres under the Education Guarantee
Scheme (EGS) and Alternative and Innovative Education (AIE). EGS and AIE
Centres across the country have been invaluable in reaching education to
children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections, especially children in
unserved habitations. However, EGS centres were, since inception, envisaged as
transitory measures to provide schooling till such time as regular, full time
schooling facilities could be provided in the area concerned. AIE centres
catered to the bridging needs of out of school children till they were
mainstreamed into regular schools. Indeed, the RTE mandate for full time
schooling facilities for all children implies that EGS centres will now have
to be upgraded to regular primary schools, and all children availing AIE will
need to be mainstreamed into full time schools in a time bound manner.
Therefore, in keeping with the RTE mandate:(i)EGS Centres: Existing EGS
centres will continue to be supported for a period of two years (2010-11,
2011-12) during which period States would take steps to convert the EGS
centres into regular primary schools. No new EGS centres will be sanctioned
under SSA with effect from the financial year 2010-11. In case, the existing
EGS centre is not required to be converted into a regular school, on account
of an existing neighbourhood school, the EGS center would be closed down and
children mainstreamed in the neighbourhood school.(ii)In place of AIE Centres,
facilities for 'Special Training' will be provided to out-of-school children,
who have been admitted to school, to enable them to cope with age-appropriate
enrollment and participation in regular elementary schools.2.5Enabling
Provisions under SSA to Universalise Access. - 2.5.1 Opening new schools: The
revised SSA norms provide for opening of new primary and upper primary schools
within the area of the limits of the neighbourhood as laid down by the State
Government under the State RTE Rules. All new schools opened under SSA will be
provided requisite school infrastructure, teachers and teaching learning
equipment as mandated under the Schedule to the RTE Act. With a view to
facilitating States to move towards composite elementary schools, the revised
norms provide that new upper primary schools/sections will be opened in the
campuses of existing primary schools.2.5.2. Overcoming barriers to opening new
schools, upgradation and expansion of schools Opening of schools within the
area/limits of neighbourhood is the responsibility of the appropriate
Government. The appropriate Government will, therefore, ensure that land is
made available for opening new schools as also upgradation and expansion of
schools. The appropriate Government would need to overcome barriers emerging
out of unavailability of land of Gram Panchayat/ ULB for opening of school.
The right based approach necessitates sensitisation of authorities dealing
with land allotments in the Revenue, Panchayat Raj, and Forest Departments to
provide land for schools on priority. Provisions such as transportation and
hostel are exception measures for areas where opening a school is not viable.
Provision of hostels for urban deprived children without adult protection is
primarily to provide them with institutional care and support facilities to
address their vulnerability.2.5.3Special Training for out-of-school children.
- The RTE Act makes specific provision for Special Training for age-
appropriate admission for out-of-school children. A majority of out-of-school
children belong to disadvantaged communities: Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes, Muslims, migrants, children with special needs, urban deprived
children, working children, children in other difficult circumstances, for
example, those living in difficult terrain, children from displaced families,
and areas affected by civil strife, etc need Special Training.2.5.3.1Special
Training for never enrolled children or those who dropped out before
completing elementary education would require an identification of children,
who must be enrolled. For this the State Government, Local Authority and
School Management Committee will need to undertake a community level school
mapping exercise. The neighbourhood and school mapping exercise will be
followed by (i) immediate enrollment in school (ii) organisation of Special
Training of flexible duration to enable the child to be at par with other
children, (iii) actual admission of the child in the age-appropriate class on
completion of Special Training, and his/her participation in all class
activities, (iv) continued support to the child, once admitted to the regular
school, so that the child can integrate with the class socially, emotionally
and academically. The RTE Act also provides that such children shall continue
to be provided free and compulsory elementary education even after they cross
14 years of age2.5.3.2The duration of Special Training may be flexible,
varying from 3 months to 2 years, depending on the child's needs. Special
Training may be in the form of residential or non-residential courses
organised, preferably in the premises of the school, but if such facilities
are not available in school, alternate facilities which are safe, secure and
accessible may be identified and used. At the end of the duration of Special
Training for a particular child, the suitability of placing the child in a
class may be reviewed. For example, if a 10- year old child was admitted to
Class IV, and received two years of Special Training till age 12, an
assessment may be made as to whether the child could cope better in Class V or
VI in the formal school, and the child appropriately placed. Even after a
child is appropriately placed in the formal school, she may continue to
receive special attention by the teacher to enable her to successfully
integrate with the rest of the class, academically and emotionally. SSA will
provide support for Special Training as envisaged under the RTE Act for out-
of- school children, who have been admitted to regular schools to ensure that
they are integrated into the school system. Such support will be in the form
of residential or non-residential courses, as needed and such children will
continue even beyond 14 years of age to complete elementary
education.2.5.4Residential facilities. - There are certain areas in the
country where it may not be viable to set up schools. These include sparsely
populated or hilly and densely forested areas with difficult geographical
terrains. There are also densely populated urban areas, where it is difficult
to get land for establishing schools. Also, in urban areas there are a number
of urban deprived children: homeless and street children in difficult
circumstances, without adult protection, who require not merely day- schooling
facilities, but also lodging and boarding facilities. Residential facilities
may be provided for these children under SSA. However, there may be an
inherent difficulty in locating such schools all over the country; the
establishment of residential schools should therefore be restricted, as an
'exception' measure to sparsely populated, hilly/forested terrains and for
urban deprived children, street children and children without adult
protection.2.5.4.1For urban deprived and children without adult protection. -
Children on the streets may suffer from many denials and vulnerabilities:
these include deprivation of responsible adult protection, coercion to work to
eat each day, work in unhealthy occupations like rag-picking, begging and sex
work, abysmally poor sanitary conditions, inadequate nutrition from begging, a
range of psycho- social stresses, physical abuse and sexual exploitation, and
exposure to hard drug abuse. For such children SSA will provide support for
residential facilities as per the following interventions:(a)Redeploying
public buildings and infrastructure. - Lack of buildings because of the high
cost of real estate in cities is the severest bottle-neck to provide
facilities for urban deprived, vulnerable children. The Government can at best
fund a few 'model' hostels, but this would not cover the tens of thousands of
street children in every city. Most State and local governments have large
unused and under-utilised buildings and infrastructure , which need to be
redeployed and shared with street children. The best and most economical
approach, and one that has the potential to reach every street child, is to
share spaces in existing schools that are vacant. Such buildings may need only
small additions for toilets, bathing places and a kitchen. Such an approach
also has the potential to lead to integration, dignity and the learning hands-
on of egalitarian compassion and pluralism.(b)Refurbishing unused old
buildings. - The sharing of existing schools should be the preferred model.
But it is also possible to secondarily rely o n refurbishing unused old
buildings, with additions and alterations. The State and municipal governments
have many buildings that are unused and under-used which can be allotted and
upgraded as residential homes. These can be old school buildings, or other
municipal or other departmental buildings. Ideally these residential schools
should also be developed as regular primary schools, so they approximate the
first model over a period of time.(c)New residential facilities. - The last
option would be the construction of new residential facilities for children
without adult protection, in which case the norms pertaining to KGBVs would
apply. The civil work cost of the hostels will be within the existing ceiling
for civil works per district.2.5.4.2Residential facilities to serve children
in sparsely populated areas. - SSA would support the construction of
residential facilities for boys and girls to serve children in sparsely
populated areas of tribal, desert or hilly districts, where it may not be
viable to set up a full-fledged school. Such facilities may be in the form of
hostel in the premises of an existing primary /upper primary school, or a
residential school where primary/upper primary school does not exist. SSA
approval for such facilities is, however, contingent on States conducting a
school mapping to ensure that there is no 'neighbourhood' school in the area
and transportation facility to and fro the school nearest to the neighbourhood
is not practical, and identifying all children who would benefit from such
intervention.This model has been adopted in Andhra Pradesh, where some
residential schools for children without adult protection have been set up as
part of existing schools in Hyderabad with support from Aman Vedike. This has
been found to have many advantages: not only low costs, but the integration of
children with families and homes with those who have been deprived, to the
great pedagogic advantage of both. Many government schools also welcomed this,
because it has pushed up the enrolment in the schools, and made them more
viable.2.5.4.3Thus, SSA will provide support for (i) addition of spaces such
as toilets, bathing spaces, kitchens in existing schools proposed to be used
as residential facilities for street children without adult protection , (ii)
refurbishing of unused buildings also for use as residential facilities for
street children without adult protection, and (iii) construction of
residential facilities to serve children in remote, sparsely populated areas,
including tribal, desert and hilly areas and street children without adult
protection in urban areas. The design should be inclusive to serve children
with disabilities as well. The construction of full-fledged hostels would be
in accordance with KGBV norms. Addition of spaces in under- utilised existing
schools or refurbishing of unused existing schools would be examined on a case
to case basis. Running costs of the hostel facilities would be as per KGBV
norms.2.5.5Transportation or Escort Facilities. - Children in remote
habitations with sparse populations or in urban areas where availability of
land is a problem or children belonging to extremely deprived groups or
children with special needs may not find access to schools. Such children may
be provided support for transportation or escort facilities. The requirement
of fluids for this facility will be kept under the National Component, to be
utilized on receipt/appraisal of district specific proposals from the State,
justifying the need for providing transportation facility to children in
sparsely populated, hilly/densely forested/desert terrains, as well as urban
areas where unavailability of land makes it unviable to set up schools as per
the 'neighbourhood' norms of the State.Sister Cyril of Loreto School, Sealdah,
has shown how it is fully feasible to provide full education to both regular
and street children. The Loreto homes are all located within existing schools.
The children enjoy the benefits of being inside a regular school with all the
activities, the interaction with the more privileged peer group of the regular
school, the rough and tumble of normal school life and the friendly
interaction with other children of various backgrounds, creeds and castes.
This positive environment enables each child to grow and reach her full
potential. When girls come off the street, they have to be prepared during the
initial period for attending classes. They will not go to a regular school
until they can fit into a class of approximately their own age group. This
normally takes one year or less. They are taught on a one to one basis by the
regular children of the school during their obligatory Work Education
classes.2.5.6School Uniforms. - The RTE Act mandates free and compulsory
education for all children in Government schools. Uniforms constitute an
expense which poor families are often not able to afford, and thus becomes a
barrier for many children pursue and complete elementary education. SSA will
provide two sets of uniform to all girls, SC, ST children and Below Poverty
Line (BPL) children, wherever (i) State Governments have incorporated
provision of school uniforms as a child entitlement in their State RTE Rules,
and (ii) State Governments are not already providing uniforms from the State
budgets. In case, any State Government is partially subsidizing the cost of
uniform being supplied to children in school, then the amount under SSA would
be restricted to the remaining.2.5.6.1The purpose of school uniforms is to
inspire a sense of belonging and ownership of the school for the children
using its services. It is not to instill a sense of regimented, homogenized
order. Therefore, decisions on design of uniforms and their procurement should
be local rather than centralized. Procurement of uniforms would be in
decentralized mode at the SMC level.2.6Addressing Systemic Issues for
Universal Access. - 2.6.1 Removal of financial barriers. - The RTE Act
provides that no child in a neighbourhood school, as notified by the State
Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of fee, charge or expense that may
prevent her/him from enrolling, participating and completing elementary
education. States may ensure convergence of resources from different schemes
of the Central and State Governments to remove financial barriers to school
access. Some expenses such as textbooks, uniforms and transportation can be
defrayed under SSA, unless these are already being provided under any other
scheme of the State Government Free noon meals will continue to be provided
under the MDM Scheme. Other schemes of the State Governments and local
authorities, such as scholarships, school bags, stationary, bus passes, etc.,
will contribute to meet the 'hidden' costs of education. All entitlements as
notified in the State RTE Rules should be provided through existing
State/Central schemes that may be further expanded to include new and specific
items for the purpose of removal of financial barriers to school
access.2.6.2Removal of procedural barriers. - The RTE Act also provides for
removal of procedural barriers to school access. It provides that no child
shall be denied admission in a school for want of a Birth or Transfer
Certificate. The Central RTE Rules provide that wherever a Birth Certificate
under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Certification Act, 1886 is not
available, an anganwadi record or an ANM record or a declaration of the age of
the child by the parent or guardian would be deemed to be proof of age.
Similarly, State RTE Rules may notify the documents that may suffice in the
absence of a Birth Certificate. Delay in issue of Transfer Certificate shall
not be a ground for denial of admission to a child in the new school.
Executive instructions may be issued to all Headmasters to issue Transfer
Certificates on priority, whenever a child requires it.2.6.3Any-time admission
in school. - Admission of a child in school is a fundamental right and it
cannot be denied at any point of time. Ideally, all children should be
enrolled in school at the beginning of the academic session. However, in the
case of children in difficult circumstances, including children affected by
migration, displacement or ill health, etc schools mav need to be flexible to
allow admission at any time during the session. The Central RTE Rules provide
that children admitted after six months of the beginning of the academic
session may be provided Special Training as determined by the Head Teacher of
the school to enable him/her to complete studies.2.6.4Ensuring an eight-year
elementary education cycle. - The National System of Education envisages a
common educational structure. At the elementary level, the national system of
education comprises five years of primary education and three years of upper
primary. Efforts have been made to follow an eight-year elementary education
cycle through out the country; however, several States continue to follow a
seven-year elementary education cycle. Existing SSA norms provide support to
States to move towards an eight- year elementary education cycle through
provisioning for additional teachers and classroom for Class VIII at the upper
primary stage.In addition, SSA will provide support for teaching learning
equipment for Classes V and VIII, in order to facilitate States to adopt an
eight-year elementary education cycle.2.7Interventions for Universalising
Access

2.8Summing Up. - 2.8.1 Universal access is an essential component of UEE.
Access does not constitute mere physical availability of school; it implies
facilitating full, free and joyful participation of children in learning. Any
barrier to children's learning means that access has been denied fully or in
part. Access comprises children's participation in learning by addressing
social, economical and linguistic barriers in addition to barriers arising out
of physical distance, topography and infrastructure etc. Interventions for
universalising access, therefore, cannot be limited to school infrastructure,
residential facility or transportation, but must encompass curriculum,
including 'hidden' curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Equitable access must
amalgamate with equitable quality to institutionalise and sustain universal
access. This would be necessary for enabling real access to children
disadvantaged in socioeconomic, cultural and linguistic terms. Such an
understanding of access must percolate to the grassroots level for enriching
the process of planning, implementation and monitoring, and moving away from
the present practice of viewing access as a stand-alone intervention dealing
merely with the physical availability of school and infrastructure. States
which are considered well provided in terms of physical access must introspect
in this perspective to determine whether or not access is really available to
all children.

### 3. Addressing Equity Issues In Elementary Education.

\- 3.1 Context3.1.1. Bridging gender and socia1 category gaps in elementary education is one of the four goals of SSA. Consequently, SSA attempts to reach out to girls and children belonging to SC, ST and Muslim Minority communities. SSA has also given attention to urban deprived children, children affected by periodic migration, and children living in remote and scattered habitations. SSA has identified Special Focus Districts on the basis of adverse performance on indicators of enrolment, retention, and gender parity, as well as concentration of SC, ST and minority communities. KGBV and NPEGEL have played an important role in furthering the goal of girls' education in educationally backward blocks of the country. Besides these, SSA is contributing to inclusive education of children with special needs.3.1.2However, given the complex and chronic nature of inequality and exclusion, the strategies adopted so far have tended to be somewhat isolated, fragmented and devoid of institutional support. As a result, the many forms that exclusion takes, and the different ways in which it is manifested, have not been sufficiently addressed across the components of access, participation, retention, achievement and completion of elementary education. This makes exclusion of the single most important challenge in universalising elementary education. With the RTE having come into force this challenge must be addressed with a sense of urgency.3.2RTE, Equity and Social Inclusion. - 3.2.1 The RTE Act, 2009 has defined children belonging to disadvantaged groups and children belonging to weaker sections as follows:Disadvantaged Groups are defined as those that belonged to the "SC, ST, socially and educationally backward class or such other groups having disadvantage owing to social, cultural, economical, geographical, linguistic, gender, or such other factors as may be specified by the appropriate Government".Weaker Sections are defined as those "belonging to such parent or guardian whose annual income is lower than the minimum specified by the appropriate Government by notification".3.2.2The Act requires the appropriate government and every local authority to "ensure that the child belonging to weaker sections and the child belonging to disadvantaged groups are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds".3.2.3In stating, thus, the RTE Act opens up the whole sphere of circumstances which come in the way of a child's enrolment and participation in school, and his/her completion of the elementary stage. This necessitates an attempt at listing of categories of children, who might be covered under Section 2(d) and (e) and spelling out possible strategies to prevent explicit and implicit discrimination in pursuing and completing elementary education.3.2.4Gender cuts across the categories of disadvantaged groups as well as weaker sections. The RTE Act in different sections makes reference to gender and girls' education both explicitly and implicitly. Some of the relevant provisions are: no discrimination against children from 'disadvantaged groups and 'weaker sections' on any grounds (including gender); inclusion of women in school monitoring committees; provision of good quality education that includes equity issues, curriculum development in conformity with constitutional stipulations, training, enrolment in age appropriated classes (which will largely apply to girls, especially from disadvantaged communities).3.3Approach - 3.3.1 The enactment of the RTE requires addressing gender and social equity within a framework that is holistic and systemic. The approach will be informed by the following perspective, which is in keeping with the principles laid out by the Report of the Committee on Implementation of RTE Act and the Resultant Revamp of SSA:• Equity will mean not only equal opportunity, butal so creation of conditions in which the disadvantaged sections of the society - children of SC, ST, Muslim minority, landless agricultural workers and children with special needs, etc. can avail of the opportunity.• Access will not be confined to ensuring that a school becomes accessible to all children within specified distance but implies an understanding of the educational needs and predicament of the traditionally excluded categories - the SC, ST and other sections of the most disadvantaged groups, the Muslim minority, girls in general, and children with special needs.• Gender will be a critical cross-cutting equity issue and will imply not only making efforts to enable girls to keep pace with boys but to view education in the perspective spelt out in the National Policy on Education, 1986/92; i.e. a decisive intervention to bring about a basic change in the status of women.• Centrality of classroom practices and processes where the culture in the classroom, and beyond the classroom, will produce an inclusive environment for children, especially for girls from oppressed and marginalised back grounds, and free from discrimination.• Quality with Equity. - Equity will be seen as an integral part of the agenda on improving quality and will, therefore, encompass not just looking at issues pertaining to teacher training and education, curriculum, language, educational planning and management.3.3.2In the context of RTE, the equity agenda of SSA would work towards:(i)Moving from an incentives -and provisions-based approach to a right and entitlement approach(ii)Developing a deeper understanding on issues contributing to exclusion and disadvantage, arising from entrenched hierarchical structures (social, language, cultural, religious backgrounds), prevalent stereotypes and the challenges faced by children from disadvantaged communities including within the school space(iii)Assessing needs of different excluded and marginalised groups and communities and consequently addressing these needs through contextualised strategies.(iv)Encouraging innovative thinking and dialogue to identify holistic, multi-pronged and viable strategies to address issues of gender, equity exclusion that will cut across the different SSA goals.(v)Encouraging up-scaling and institutionalisation of interventions and strategies found effective, viable and sustainable with a view to strengthening the mainstream education system.3.3.3Equity in SSA would, therefore, mean focus on addressing exclusion of girls and children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Muslim communities who constitute the bulk of excluded children in the country. It will also refer to a new category of excluded children - those living in areas affected by civil strife. It will also take into account, children affected from migration, urban deprived children, homeless children, children in remote and sparsely populated habitations, other groups and categories of excluded children and CWSN. It will also mean including gender and other equity issues within the quality goal.3.4Gender and Girls' Education. - 3.4.1 Perspective. - SSA acknowledges that reaching out to the girl child is central to the efforts to universalise elementary education. SSA's focus on gender parity is rooted in the National Policy on Education and the POA (1986/92) which brought centre-stage the issue of gender and girls' education. More importantly, it linked with the education of women and girls to their empowerment. NPE states that education should be a transformative force, build women's self-confidence, and improve their position in society and challenge inequalities.3.4.2The approach to gender and girls' education will be based on the report of the Committee on Implementation of the RTE Act and the Resultant Revamp of SSA, which pointed out that although gender has become an accepted category in policy and programme formulation, it continues to be understood in limited ways. It is largely seen as a biological category (concerning only girls and women); as a stand-alone category (not related to other issues or other forms of discrimination); and in terms of provision of opportunities so that girls can 'catch up' with boys and 'close the gap'. Thus, achieving gender parity has been an overarching concern of the education system. While this is of critical importance and has led to some impressive improvements in girls' enrolment, retention and completion, it has also led to gender being understood primarily in quantitative terms.3.4.3In the next phase of SSA implementation, gender and social disadvantage must become integral to concerns of quality and equity. Gender as-a crosscutting issue should be viewed as an integral and visible part of the quality agenda. Girls are not a homogeneous or singular category and gender does not operate in isolation but in conjunction with other social categories resulting in girls 'having to experience multiple forms of disadvantage. The dimensions of location (rural-urban), caste, class, religion, ethnicity, disabilities etc. intersect with gender to create a complex reality. Curriculum, textbooks, pedagogic practices, need to capture the entire web of social and economic relations that determine an individual's location in the social reality and shapes her living experiences. Developing such an understanding is necessary for improving classroom practices, curriculum, training and strategies for reaching the remaining out-of- school children. Data on gender should be further disaggregated by other axes of disadvantage, it must be analysed and used for planning purposes.3.4.4While there has been improvement and innovation in the area of gender and girls education, many interventions like gender training remain largely sporadic and continue to be seen as 'add-ons'. With RTE coming into effect, the thrust would now be to mainstream good practices and processes within the education system.3.4.5Efforts pertaining to gender have focused mainly on females. As a result, several women have been empowered and a space has been made to raise gender concerns and develop a better understanding of the structural and social barriers to girls' education. However, since the long-term objective is to transform unequal gender relations and bring about systemic change, therefore, it would be equally important to build on these gains and include boys and men more significantly in this process.3.4.6In order to address gender, it is, therefore, necessary to go beyond specific schemes and provisions and be treated as a systemic issue.3.5Girls: Access & Retention. - 3.5.1 Despite significant improvement in the enrolment of girls, girls from disadvantaged communities continue to form the bulk of out- of school children. Therefore, access continues to be an equity issue in the case of girls. Also, there is a need to consider retention as an equity issue, as SC, ST, Muslim girls, are vulnerable, and most likely to dropout. Parents of children from such communities often have limited means, and any adversity compels girls from such communities to leave the system that they had difficulty of entering in the first place. The overt and tacit forms of discrimination that are embedded in the school environment (classrooms and beyond) make schooling a difficult experience. A key focus in SSA will be to address this challenge.3.5.2With regard to access and retention the focus would be on older girls, where the need is the greatest. Support measures that address economic, academic and social dimensions that lead to dropout would need to be planned as a more cohesive intervention. Measures would include transport, escorts, counselling, helping them negotiate domestic work burdens, community support mechanisms, and academic support depending on the nature of the problem.3.5.3Moreover, as adolescence is a crucial and complex stage of life where young people discover issues related to sexuality and develop a sense of self, innovative measures to bolster girls' self-esteem and confidence (in addition to imparting the regular curricula content) would be included. Attention would be paid to addressing the particular needs of girls from other disadvantaged groups or those living in difficult circumstances (street children, migrant children, and girls in conflict situations). Girls in such situations are particularly vulnerable and face several security concerns. Some activities already conducted as part of the NPEGEL Scheme (where operational), and SS A's Innovation Fund could be used for supporting those interventions which cannot be supported under any other norm.3.6Gender, Equity and Quality. - 3.6.1 Issues of quality and equity are inextricably linked. It is important to understand that poor quality impacts on equity and poor equity reinforces poor quality. Therefore, efforts which are aimed at one must also include the other. Within SSA, quality concerns are being increasingly highlighted, and the approach to quality improvement is undergoing a major shift to become integrated, comprehensive and overarching. In the context of implementing the RTE Act, this approach shift to quality would have to be enriched whereby the curriculum, textbooks, teaching-learning materials, the use of space in the classroom, infrastructure, assessment and teacher trainings are looked at holistically and mutually reinforce each other. Each of these issues would need to be addressed by a gender perspective.3.7Special Schemes for Girls. - 3.7.1 National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level3.7.1.1The National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) is a focused intervention of Government of India, to reach the "Hardest to Reach" girls, especially those not in school. NPEGEL is a separate, gender-distinct but integral component of SSA, which provides additional support for enhancing girls' education over and above the investments for girls' education through normal SSA interventions.3.7.1.2NPEGEL is implemented in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) where the level of rural female literacy is less than the national average i.e. 46.13% (Census, 2001) and the gender gap in literacy is above the national average i.e. 21.67 % (Census, 2001); in blocks of districts which are not covered under EBBs but have at least 5% SC/ST population and where SC/ST female literacy is below 10%; and also in selected urban slums. To keep the emphasis on the programme as a distinct component of the SSA a separate account is maintained for NPEGEL. [NPEGEL has been amended twice since its inception, first, in July, 2007 to provide for block focused projects for girls at risk/difficult circumstances, and later in December 2010] [The revised NPEGEL guidelines are at Annexure 5.] to provide flexibility in devising and implementing need based interventions.3.7.1.3Various reviews have identified concerns related to the scheme as being-uneven quality; fragmented approach where activities are picked up from the indicative list and do not form a cohesive strategy; overlap of activities with other components of the scheme such as the AIE component; local planning not strong enough; activities/ strategies related to gender have remained an add-on and not mainstreamed; no review of quality of modules etc. being produced; insufficient impact of the gender training programmes on making classroom practices more gender sensitive; impact of the model cluster school is not certain; etc. The planning and implementation process should keep in mind that the problems mentioned are in line with the provisions of the RTE. Efforts should be made to identify good practices from different States as well as strengths and weaknesses in the light of SSA transformation to implement the RTE.3.7.2Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV)3.7.2.1Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) provides for setting up residential schools at the upper primary level for girls belonging predominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minority communities. KGBVs are set up in educationally backward blocks, where the female rural literacy is below the national average (i.e. below 46.13% as per Census 2001) and gender gap in literacy is above the national average of 21.67%. Further, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to cover the blocks that have rural female literacy below 30% and urban areas with female literacy more than the national female literacy (urban) of53.67% as per Census 2001. This was again enlarged to cover all the educationally backward blocks with rural female literacy of 46.13%.3.7.2.2Such residential schools are set up only in those educationally backward blocks which do not have residential schools at the upper primary level for girls under any other scheme of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Ministry of Tribal Affairs or the State Government. This shall be ensured by the District Level Authority of SSA at the time of actual district level planning of KGBV initiatives by coordinating with the other Departments/Ministries.3.7.2.3[KGBV programme has been revised twice since its inception, first in April 2008 when criteria for identifying EBB was revised, and, later, in April, 2010, when the criteria was revised again besides the decision to allow unit cost for civil works according to the state SoR rather than the fixed cost] [The revised KGBV guidelines are at Annexure 6.]. The importance of the KGBV Scheme in addressing the educational needs of girls from marginalised communities has been highlighted in various reviews. KGBVs run by MS and NGOs are particularly successful as they augment resources to bring in empowerment-oriented content. Lessons can be learnt from their experiences. The scheme would be strengthened with the development of an appropriate curriculum framework which would include empowerment issues, teaching- learning material, teacher training programmes and monitoring and assessment mechanisms keeping in mind the contexts, and age of the learners and the residential nature of the scheme which could be taken up with the involvement of experienced organizations, especially with a strong gender orientation.3.7.3Mahila Samakhya3.7.3.1Mahila Samakhya (MS) programme was started nearly 20 years ago and has been recognised as an effective strategy for creating circumstances for girls 'education and empowerment. The critical thing in this programme is that its agenda and priorities are set by women's groups, called Mahila Sanghas, themselves. At the time, when this programme was started questions were raised whether it would in fact contribute to girls' education. Over the years Mahila Sanghas and their federations have themselves given a place of importance to girls' education. They play an active role in working towards removal of barriers to the participation of girls in education.3.7.3.2The Mahila Sanghas ensure that the education system is sensitive to the needs and interests of girls through monitoring and ensuring accountability in village schools, addressing teacher absenteeism, M D M implementation and quality, etc. Mahila Samakhya has demonstrated the possibilities and practicable ways of creating and using gender-sensitive curriculum, class room pedagogy, teacher training and life-skills.Sangha women are often members of village level committees, and play an important role in SSA implementation and monitoring.3.7.3.3This spirit of MS and the overall tenor of the RTE provide enormous scope for synergic outputs. Special mention in this regard should be made of the fact that occasionally one year's of MS being expected to sub-serve the goals of SSA. This would not be in accordance with the stipulation of NPE, 1986. MS should continue to zealously adhere to its non-negotiable principles, including the stipulation which gives to them space for making their own decisions regarding programme priorities and implementation strategies. The role of M S would be in monitoring and grievance redressal; development of training strategies for SMCs especially women members; Mahila Shikshan Kendras have demonstrated ability to run bridge courses and to develop necessary curricula and teaching-learning arrangements. They could make an important contribution in conducting programmes for children who get admitted to age-appropriate classes but require preparatory courses to keep pace with other students. MSK can function as centre for special training for out of school children who have been enrolled in regular schools.3.8Inclusion of Children from Marginalised Communities3.8.1Strategies3.8.1.1As a first step in the exercise of bringing children from marginalised backgrounds into school a careful mapping of these children - who they are and where they live - will have to be undertaken systematically. While SSA has already identified Special Focus Districts (SFDs) with concentration of SC, ST and Muslim communities, a further unpacking of the layers of exclusion that exist within these districts will be required by the local authorities, who have been given the role of identifying out-of- school children and ensuring that they are brought into school. Since the RT E Act guarantees elementary education in a neighbourhood school, I the neighbourhood can be the best unit for identification of marginalised children. In order to do this job effectively, it will be imperative that the local authorities work closely with communities and community-based groups I that have links within communities and can help in identifying the out-of-school children.3.8.1.2The School Management Committees (SMCs) envisaged in the RTE Act would have to play a key role in the mapping exercise as well as in ensuring inclusive strategies in the School Development Plan, the preparation of which has also been entrusted to them.3.8.2Understanding exclusionary practices3.8.2.1In addition to the mapping mentioned above, an in-depth understanding of the realities of the situation faced by marginalised children at the community and school level, including an identification of all the points of exclusion from the level of the household up to education system will be required.3.8.2.2Exclusionary practices often begin even before a child reaches the school premises. A SC girl, for instance, travelling through an upper caste hamlet on her way to school may face harassment on her way that could well discourage her, and dissuade her parents from sending her to school. Parents of children from Muslim families may also have similar inhibitions in sending their children to schools that are located in area dominated by the majority community. Safety of children regularly subjected to derogatory name calling, rebuking, even physical harassment is a significant factor determining participation of children from such backgrounds in school. Children from SC, ST and Muslim communities have both common as well as unique needs and challenges impeding attempts to their inclusion. Following is the brief account of needs and nature of exclusion pertaining to each community as extracted from the Report of the Committee on Implementation of RTE and Resultant Revamp of SSA.3.8.2.3Following is the broad listing of examples of exclusion of SC children:Exclusion by Teachers. - (i) Segregated seating arrangements in the classroom with SC children made to sit separately and typically at the back of the classroom.(ii)Undue harshness in reprimanding SC children, especially in relation to upper caste children. For instance, in scolding children for coming late to school, in resolving fights between children, condoning name-calling by upper caste children, etc..(iii)Not giving time and attention to SC children in the classroom, such as not checking their homework or class work, not answering their queries - even rebuking them for asking questions in class.(iv)Excluding SC children from public functions in the school. These include non-participation in the morning assembly or other public events such as on Republic Day or Independence Day. Routinely making them sit at the back of the classroom.(v)Making derogatory remarks about SC children - their supposed inability to keep up with academic work.(vi)Denying SC children the use of school facilities, including water sources. Keeping water segregated; even preventing SC children from using the school taps or containers used to store drinking water have been reported from many areas.(vii)Asking SC children to do menial tasks in school, including cleaning the school premises and even the toilets.Exclusion by peer group. - (i) Calling SC children by caste names.(ii)Not including SC children in games and play activities in the classroom or in break time when children go out to play; SC children often return to their own neighbourhoods to play with non- enrolled SC children there.(iii)Not sitting with SC children in the classroom.Exclusion by the system. - (i) Incentives schemes meant for SC children not being implemented in full.(ii)Lack of acknowledgement of SC role models in the curriculum or by teachers.(iii)Reinforcing caste characteristics in syllabi and textbooks.(iv)Lack of sensitisation of teachers in teacher education and training.(v)In sufficient recruitment of SC teachers.3.8.2.4.The interventions for children belonging to Scheduled Caste communities have to be based on the intensive micro-planning addressing the needs of every child. The following suggested list of interventions for inclusion of SC children can help in addressing the aforestated practices of discrimination and exclusion.(i)Establishing norms of behaviour within the school for teachers and students.(ii)Timely detection of the forms of discrimination practiced in a particular context by either teachers or students. This is not an easy task as many forms of discrimination have become part of accepted behaviour and go unnoticed and unchallenged by the majority. Finding ways of listening to children's voices would be crucial to this exercise. Setting up a system of reporting on discriminatory practices at the school level would be a place to start. Complaint boxes that are regularly dealt with at SMC meetings are a suggested intervention.(iii)Timely redressal of instances of discrimination at the level of the school or Block. Delays in taking action can lead to discouragement on the part of the parents and teachers.(iv)Escorts to school for SC children.(v)Establishing norms for class room interactions such as seating patterns that ensure that children are not segregated on the basis of caste, community or gender. The 'Nali-Kali' model of multilevel learning, pioneered in Karnataka in the mid nineties, (based on the Rishi Valley School-in-a-bag programme) is worth revisiting and adopting as it allows children to sit in groups based on levels of learning. This not only breaks social barriers but it also allows for a rotation and thus inter- mingling as children move in and out of the learning circles.(vi)Co-curricular activities, such as sports, music and drama which tend to break social barriers among children need to be encouraged. They have remained a hugely neglected area and would be an important strategy for increasing the interaction of children as well as allowing children from varied backgrounds to exhibit their talents and get recognition.(vii)Recognizing the agency of teachers. The teacher is a key figure in the school and can help to either perpetuate or obliterate discriminatory practices. But her role in this process has been largely neglected so far. Interventions in the following areas would go a long way in overturning the current situation.(a)Sensitisation of teachers from the stage of pre-service training onwards. Special modules should be developed by recognised experts for use in teacher education and training programmes. Special in-service training within the mandated 20 days should be organised to deal with the specific problems of inclusion at the Block level.(b)Setting norms for teacher behaviour. Some norms related to corporal punishment and abuse have been included in the RTE. Strict monitoring and adherence to these norms would help obliterates some of the malpractices mentioned above, such as making SC child re n perform menial tasks.(viii)Helping the teacher develop pedagogical tools and classroom practices that allow social barriers to be broken. Technical support in developing such tools should be sought from experts as well as civil society groups.(ix)Providing adequate infrastructure for elementary schooling in districts with concentration of SC population.(x)Opening schools in SC concentrated neighbourhood wherever required.(xi)Special training as per need for age appropriate admission(xii)Interventions for specific categories of deprived children belonging to scheduled caste community living in difficult circumstances.(xiii)Monitoring attendance and retention of children regularly(xiv)Providing context specific intervention in the form of a special facility like residential schools or transport as required.3.8.2.5SSA recognises that problems of exclusion often take highly local and context specific forms, and the above mentioned is a general list of issues that have emerged from the studies conducted so far, which need to be addressed urgently.3.8.2.6Exclusion of Scheduled Tribe Children: ST children, besides facing some of the exclusionary practices mentioned above for SC children also face problems peculiar to their situation. Tribal populations tend to be concentrated in remote, hilly or heavily forested areas with dispersed populations where even physical access to schools is difficult. If there are schools and teachers, the teachers are unlikely to share the students' social and cultural background or to speak the students' language, leading to a sense of alienation among the children.3.8.2.7The Tribal Welfare Department has tried to address this problem by establishing residential or 'Ashram' schools for tribal children; however, there is a need not just for many more residential schools but also for improved quality in these schools. With the notification of the RTE Act, 'Ashram' schools would also come under its purview and have to follow the prescribed norms and standards. Collaboration with the Education Department on residential schools for tribal dominated are as would be required to enable a strengthened and consolidated approach to this problem including recruitment of teachers of similar social and cultural backgrounds and provision of curricula and textbooks that are not alienating for tribal children.3.8.2.8The biggest problem faced by tribal children is that of language. Analysis of the educational indicators shows that majority of tribal children drop out of the primary school due to the difference in the school and home language. Teaching materials and textbooks tend to be in a language which could easily the students understand; content of books and syllabi ignore the students' own knowledge and experience and focus only on the dominant language and culture. Not understanding the school language and therefore the course content, the children are unable to cope, end up repeating grades and eventually dropping out.3.8.2.9While instruction in the mother tongue is widely recognised as beneficial to language competencies in the first language, achievement in other subject areas, and second language learning, there is no explicit obligation on the states to institute mother tongue education. The "three language formula" that has been the cornerstone of the language policy in India has not been uniformly implemented across the country. In some states such as Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh, which are linguistically diverse, the problem is compounded by the multiplicity of linguistic backgrounds represented in a single classroom.3.8.2.10Providing multilingual education is not a simple task. Even mother tongue education is challenged by a host of problems such as:(i)the language may not have a script;(ii)the language may not even be generally recognised as constituting a legitimate language;(iii)appropriate terminology for education purposes may still have to be developed within the language;(iv)there may be a shortage of educational materials in the language;(v)there may be a lack of appropriately trained teachers;(vi)there may be resistance to schooling in the mother tongue by students, parents and teachers and(vii)if there are several mother tongues represented in one class, it compounds the problem even further.3.8.2.11Educational research has shown that the mother tongue is the best medium of instruction, and inclusion of tribal children hinges crucially on the language issue. With the RTE Act adding immediacy to their inclusion, this issue must be addressed fully, rather than ignored due to the complexities involved. For this, support will be needed from all quarters interested in and accountable to a pluralistic social order that will ensure enhanced participation of the tribal people. For a start, the Tribal Welfare and Education Departments, responsible for implementation, will need to communicate with each other and interact with NGOs and scholars who could support the processes. The states that have shown some initiative in this regard will also need to be supported.3.8.2.12The following suggested list of interventions for inclusion of ST children can help in addressing the above practices of discrimination and exclusion:(i)Teaching in the local language by recruiting native speakers.(ii)Development of educational material in local languages using resources available within the community.(iii)Establishing resource centres in tribal dominated states for providing training, academic and other technical support for development of pedagogic tools and education materials catering to multi lingual situations.(iv)Training of teachers in multilingual education.(v)Sensitisation of teachers to tribal cultures and practices.(vi)Incorporation of local knowledge in the curriculum and textbooks.(vii)Creating spaces for cultural mingling within schools so as to recognise tribal cultures and practices and obliterate feelings of inferiority and alienation among tribal children.(viii)Involvement of community members in school activities to reduce social distance between the school and the community.(ix)Textbooks in mother tongue for children at the beginning of Primary education where they do not understand regional language.(x)Anganwadis and Balwadis in each school in tribal areas so that the girls are not required to do baby-sitting.(xi)Special training for non-tribal teachers to work intribalare as, including knowledge of the tribal dialect.(xii)Special plan for nomadic and migrant workers.3.8.2.13Exclusion of Muslim Children : Education of Muslim children continues to be a particularly neglected area in policy and programming in India today. As a result their educational attainments are second only to those of the Scheduled Caste populations in most areas as mentioned in the Sachar Committee Report.3.8.2.14Constraints felt by Muslim Children From the scattered bits of evidence that do exist, it can be said that in addition to the general issues of discrimination and harassment faced by children from other disadvantaged and excluded groups, children from Muslim families face some of the following constraints as well:(i)Denial of admission(ii)Unfriendly school and class room environment(iii)Cultural and religious domination(iv)Early withdrawal of male children to enable them to apprentice! with artisans, mechanics, etc., to enable self-employment as: discrimination in the organised labour market is a huge perceived! concern.(v)Even earlier withdrawal of female children to enable them to find* grooms more educated than themselves.(vi)Unfulfilled demand for adequate number of Urdu medium schools or at least Urdu as a second language(vii)Lack of Urdu language teachers3.8.2.15Some [interventions] [MHRD implements the Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madarsas (SPQEAl) and the Scheme/or 1 Infrastructure Development for Minority Institutions (IDM1). Copies of the Schemes are attached at j Annexures 7 and 8. Guidelines issued vide Notification No. 1-15/2010-EE-4 dated 23rd November 2010on 1 the applicability of the RTE Act on Minority Institutions in the light of Article 29 and 30 of the Constitution j of India is at Annexure 9.] for inclusion of Muslim children can be:(i)Systematic and robust research on specific constraints faced by | Muslim children in different areas. Muslims, like SCs and STs are not a homogeneous community and exhibit wide differences in social and cultural practices in different states. A more thorough understanding of these issues will help formulate better interventions for inclusion of Muslim children into the education process.(ii)Opening of schools in Muslim concentrated neighbourhoods. I(iii)Providing 'girls only' schools in Muslim concentrated 1 neighbourhoods.(iv)Providing Urdu medium schools in Muslim concentrated I neighbourhoods.(v)Providing escort to Muslim girls, preferably through women I from the community for safe school going(vi)Option of learning Urdu as a second language(vii)Recruitment of more Urdu teachers, especially in Muslim concentrated areas;(viii)Context specific and tailor made programmes for special training. 1(ix)Sensitisation of all teachers to issues of cultural and religious diversity especially in relation to Muslims.(x)Incorporation of practices, such as(a)due representation of Muslim culture in curricular and pedagogical processes;(b)encouraging discussion of Muslim cultural and religious practices in the school or classroom with the help of community members;(c)celebration of Muslim festivals in the schools;(d)sensitive handling of Muslim children during Ramzan when they may be fasting and(e)adequate representation of Muslim parents in the SMC.3.82.16A large part of exclusion results from social distance caused by lack of knowledge and understanding about minority communities. Finding spaces to break these information barriers would go a long way in reducing the hostilities and insecurities that exist.3.8.2.17Children belonging to most under-privileged groups: SSA recognizes the hierarchies among the poor. There are groups which are not only the most, deprived and exploited, but also quite neglected. These groups deserve a special priority and focused action. SSA functionaries will have to carefully assess their needs and then plan context specific, innovative integrated interventions to make tangible progress in eliminating exclusion of children belonging to these groups. The following groups by far have been classified among the most disadvantaged groups:(i)Urban deprived children(ii)Child labour, particularly bonded child labour and domestic workers(iii)Children in ecologically deprived area where they are required to fetch fuel, water, fodder and do other household chores(iv)Children in very poor slum communities and uprooted urban habitations(v)Children of families of scavengers and other such stigmatised professions(vi)Children of itinerant or seasonal labour who have mobile and transient lifestyle like construction workers, road workers and workers on large construction sites(vii)Children of landless agriculture labour(viii)Nomadic communities and pastoralists(ix)Forests dwellers and tribals in remote areas and children residing in remote desert hamlets(x)Children in areas affected by civil strife3.8.2.18Children belonging to these groups and others who are in circumstances of extreme deprivation will need exceptional arrangements put in place in the perspective of children's rights. One among the most appropriate learning situations for them could be well established hostels and residential schools as well as transportation to and fro school besides other integrated and participatory interventions in collaboration with government agencies, NGOs and community.3.8.2.19A major issue concerning children in extremely difficult circumstances is sheer lack of their voice due to their alienation from community and little representation in agencies and forums like the SMC, PTA or VEC. SSA would make efforts to address this issue by advocacy for children's right to participation, by supporting the formation of support groups children's collectives, and, by encouraging efforts to accommodate their voices in planning, implementation and monitoring of interventions and strategies.3.8.2.20Situation analysis and interventions for some of the largest among the aforesaid groups of most underprivileged children i.e. children affected from migration, the urban deprived children, children in areas affected by civil strife, and, children termed as "excluded among the excluded", have been discussed in the following paragraphs.3.8.2.21Education of children affected by migration. - To address the issue of seasonal migration for varying periods for work in brick kilns, agriculture, sugarcane harvesting , construction, stone quarrying, salt pans etc. and its adverse effect on education of children who migrate with or without other members of the family, SSA encourages identification of districts, blocks and villages/cities or towns from where or to which there is a high incidence of migration. The RTE Act mandates bringing such children to regular schools both in districts where they stay or in districts to where they seasonally migrate. This would require innovative and effective strategies for special training to develop age appropriate competencies to facilitate children's enrolment and retention in age-appropriate classes, and to coordinate between the education providing agencies at both the locations mentioned above.3.8.2.22Special Training strategies for these children would require very meticulous planning. Some strategies can be developed on the following ideas: (a) seasonal hostels or residential camps to retain children in the sending villages/urban habitat during the period of migration, (b) transportation facility to and from the school in the vicinity of the worksite, and if it is not practical then work-site schools should be provided at the location where migrant families are engaged in work, (c) peripatetic educational volunteer/s who can move with the migrating families to take care of children's education during the period they are on move from school at one location to school at the other, and, (d) strategies for tracking of children through migration cards / other records to enable continuity in their education before, during and after the migration.3.8.2.23The receiving district /State where migrant families are located for some period shall have responsibility for ensuring that education to the children in age appropriate classes continues during the period of migration. It is expected that the AWP&Bs of these districts would include activities for education of such children, under Special Training component. The involvement of NGOs in the processes of mapping of migration and planning and implementation of interventions should be actively supported. Funds available under innovation can be used to support activities in an integrated strategy which are not supported under any other Norm of SSA.3.8.2.24Since migration takes place across districts and states, it would be necessary for sending and receiving districts and States to collaborate with each other to ensure continuity of education of such children and by other means such as providing appropriate textbooks, teachers, who can teach in the language in which children have been receiving education. For this purpose "task forces" could be set up to effect regular coordination between States/ districts.3.8.2.25The appraisal process of the AWP&B would scrutinise if areas of high incidence of migration have been identified and whether strategies for education of seasonally migrating children have been included in district and State plans.3.8.2.26Urban Deprived Children. - SSA has been focusing on the growing problem of schooling of disadvantaged children in urban areas. Successive JRMs have also dwelt on this component. Urban areas have special challenges like the education of street children, the education of children who are rag pickers, homeless children, children whose parents are engaged in professions that makes children's education difficult, education of children living in urban working class slums, children who are working in industry, children working in households, children at tea shops, garages etc. Other city specific features are: very high cost of land, heterogeneous community and high opportunity cost etc.3.8.2.27Moreover, due to multiplicity of education providers and the agencies managing education, often a number of initiatives for UEE do not reach the urban area schools. Such a situation results in inadequacy or lack of quality improvement, consequently augmenting the number of urban deprived children. States have taken initiatives ranging from identification through surveys to provide basic amenities in the form of shelter homes, networking with departments, programmes and agencies like Welfare, JNNURM, Municipal corporations and NGOs etc. Some significant efforts have been made in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Bhopal, Lucknow, Patna and Jabalpur by municipal agencies and education departments in collaboration with NGOs.3.8.2.28However, despite these initiatives, there is a growing need for systemic and coordinated efforts to provide solutions on an institutional basis to urban issues. Thus to implement RTE in urban areas, SSA would adopt a more holistic and systems approach. This approach would necessitate coordination and convergence of interventions across Departments, local bodies, civil society organisations and the private sector. SSA would encourage a diversity of interventions planned and executed in integrated, collaborative and cohesive manner to tackle the unique challenges in urban areas. This would require planning distinctively for the urban areas either as separate plans or as part of District Plans in the case of smaller towns. In either case, this would require partnership with NGOs, Municipal bodies, etc.3.8.2.29Mapping and identification of out of school children in urban areas may require special efforts. Whole city planning for ensuring coverage of all eligible children in the drive for UEE would be rigorously adopted in SSA. The Municipal Corporation of larger cities will be considered as "district" for purposes of preparation of Elementary Education Plans.The arrangements for decentralised management will also apply to these proposals. These proposals can be developed by Municipal Corporations and the State government will have to recommend these for funding under SSA, clearly specifying the source from which the State share would be provided. All SSA norms will apply to urban areas. Besides wards, urban slum clusters etc. have so far been units of planning in different cities. However, experience has shown that these units need to be more micro, so as to effectively address the idea behind habitation planning. More thinking and deliberation in this context would help in equitable planning for urban deprived children.3.8.2.30Children in areas affected by civil strife. - This is a new area of growing concern that is leading to the marginalisation of large number of children from educational processes. SSA recognizes the situation of these children as an alarming and significant problem and advocates for concrete steps to ameliorate the situation as early as possible. Some measures to insulate children and their education from the impact of such situation can be -(i)prohibiting the use of school and other educational facilities for housing police, military or para-military forces.(ii)making schools safe zones by providing adequate security and emotional support to enable children to come to school and continue with their education undisturbed.(iii)If security cannot be provided then making alternative arrangements for all affected children to enable them to continue their education without a break. These arrangements could include providing residential schooling facilities or transportation to safer schools to children from the affected areas.(iv)Organising special negotiations with leaders in these areas to ensure that schools are allowed to function uninterrupted.3.8.2.31Excluded among the excluded. - SSA acknowledges that by no means have the above categories exhausted the whole list of children excluded from the education process. While children with special needs are being dealt with in a separate section, children from migrant families with nomadic background, children working as domestic help, children in conflict with law, children in protective institutions, children affected by HIV/AIDS, children affected by natural disasters, to name a few, are some that have not been explicitly mentioned above or dealt with elsewhere. Special strategies to enable their participation will have to be developed. Support in developing these strategies, advocating for them and monitoring the continued participation of these children will be important elements of SSA's focus in the context of implementation of the RTE Act.3.8.2.32There are many active civil society groups that have gained substantial experience and knowledge of working with these children. Active involvement of these groups must be sought to enable their inclusion in the education process. A process of empanelling such groups for resource support would be a good starting point. However, more active engagement of the education department as well as NCPCR/SCPCR or REPA will be necessary to ensure that these children do not remain excluded.3.9Innovative Activities for Supplementing Mainstream Interventions to Promote Inclusion3.9.1SSA will develop context specific interventions, over and above the mainstreamed interventions, to address the problem of exclusion of girls and children belonging to marginalised communities and disadvantaged groups. This will include interventions for girls, early childhood care and education, children of SC, ST & Muslim communities, urban deprived children, and other groups of children in difficult circumstances, such as child laborers, children affected from migration, children without adult protection) children in conflict with law, etc. All successful interventions so far will serve as exemplars for pre paring such interventions. Need specific, innovative interventions will be articulated and formulated interms of their objectives, rationale, methodology, timeframe, expected outcomes and monitoring etc.3.9.2Innovation should be integrated with mainstream interventions in SSA and lead to tangible progress at least in one, if not more components of universal elementary education. SSA would provide to each district upto Rs. 50 lakh for innovative activities for equity to support mainstream SSA interventions to include children belonging to marginalised communities and disadvantaged groups. In the revised norms, the ceiling of Rs. 15 lakh per district for a maximum of four projects has been removed.3.9.3While SSA would encourage a wide variety of need based, local specific innovations, some examples of context specific innovative intervention for marginalised communities and disadvantaged groups can include:(i)Awareness building on child rights and entitlements as per the RTE Act at the grassroot level.(ii)Providing avenues and creating forums for encouraging the voice of children as key stakeholders in the education system.(iii)Viable interventions to promote enrolment and retention.(iv)Innovative strategies for special training to groups of most disadvantaged children.(v)Forming support groups and safety nets for children without adult protection, homeless children, children working as domestic help, child beggars and other groups of children in extremely difficult circumstances(vi)Strengthening of ECCE centres and support in capacity building of ECCE workers.(vii)Community mobilisation and capacity building to facilitate preparation of school development plan.(viii)Community based monitoring of teacher and student attendance, child participation and protection of their rights.(ix)Building a congenial earning environment inside and outside the school.3.10SSA Interventions for Gender and Social Equity3.10.1In order to implement the gender and equity dimensions of the RTE Act, SSA will focus on the following issues:3.10.2Training and academic support(i)Since the clear aim under the RTE Act is to have a gender sensitive, non-discriminatory classroom that is free of corporal punishment and mental harassment, there is a need to bring about substantial improvement in the curricular design and quality of teacher training. Gender and social inclusion concerns, as an integral part of pre- service, in-service and induction training by all providers, should form a core aspect of the training curriculum of DIETs and other Teacher Educational Institutions. Gender and social category equality, as also equality of all other deprived groups enumerated above should also be integral to the subject- specific content. In-service training programmes are in place in all States, but their quality remains a matter of concern. For this the modules developed by the states would be revised and redeveloped, if needed. Mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of such training in leading to a more egalitarian classroom would need to be put in place.(ii)In order to take what one has learnt during training into the classroom, there is need for on going support and monitoring. District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs), Block Resource Centres (BRC) and Cluster Resource Centres (CRC) are playing this role. However, the quality of support provided by these institutions needs to improve. Thus, capacity building of DIETs, BRCs and CRCs will be a prime focus in the context of gender and social equity as well. The support of experienced organisations would come in handy in this effort.(iii)The provision of 50% female teachers has been effective in bringing large numbers of women into the education system. However, the problems faced by female teachers need to be given due recognition. Female teachers should be supported to over come security concerns or dealing with other forms of gender bias, including harassment. Forming forums or support groups of female teachers could also be of help in this regard.3.10.3Curriculum and classroom practices(i)NCF 2005 provides a framework for revising the syllabi, textbooks, teacher- training and assessment, especially in relation to classroom experience of children belonging to SC, ST and minorities, girls in all social categories, and children with special needs. Efforts should be made by all states/UTs to undertake reform processes based on the NCF-2005.(ii)It is equally important to see how inequalities operate at the level of everyday classroom practices (referred to as the 'hidden curriculum'). Some crucial aspects of the 'hidden curriculum' in schools would be : class room arrangement ( who sits where), differential task assignment (reinforcing that SC girls undertake the 'domestic' tasks (sweeping, cleaning), extra-curricular activities and types of play etc., subject choice (often girls or children from SC families are actively discouraged from taking Mathematics and Science subjects), language used by teachers and peers in the school environment etc . It is, therefore, important to make explicit different aspects of the 'hidden curriculum' and then undertake sensitisation measures to work on these issues. Sensitisation may not be enough and classroom practices would need to be monitored, and for this protocols and grievance redressal mechanisms should be established at the school and other levels. SSA acknowledges that bringing about change in these realms is extremely difficult as they are based on deeply entrenched beliefs and attitudes, and, therefore, need to be worked on a sustained basis.(iii)With regard to Special Training to support age-appropriate enrolment, appropriate curriculum would have to be developed. As a majority of the children who would be availing this would be girls, and children belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections, the pedagogy used should be gender sensitive and flexible. The mainstreamed children would require continued support to keep pace with other children and to hold their own in the face of subtle discrimination.(iv)SSA would facilitate non-government and other organisations and individuals with relevant experience to play the role of resource organisations/persons for mainstreaming gender issues and for developing appropriate curriculum, teaching learning materials, gender informed ped ago gies and teacher training for NPEGEL and KGBV and training of BRC, CRC etc. It is noteworthy that in order to put into practice the integrated quality improvement framework, where gender and equity form an integral part, strong resource support would be needed by the States and UTs.3.11Monitoring Gender and Social Inclusion Provisions3.11.1Issues of gender and social exclusion require careful monitoring. Monitoring and accountability mechanisms would be evolved and strengthened at different levels.3.11.2The RTE Act stipulates that 50% of the parents in the SMC will be women. However, for these women to function effectively and for them to be able to address and monitor gender issues and to include them in school development plans, capacity building inputs being provided to them should include a strong element of gender sensitization. Raising issues of discrimination in a community context where social, gender and caste hierarchies operate at many levels is a difficult task and persons entrusted to do so will have to be empowered and supported in this process. Similar training programmes can be thought of for PRIs. The support of NGOs and programmes like Mahila Samakhya that have demonstrated how this can be done should be actively sought.3.11.3Social audits should also report on the practices inside the school and classrooms, and detection of gender based discrimination should become an integral part of social audit processes in schools under different management system, including, private managements.3.12Education of Children with Special Needs3.12.1A group that forms a very important part of equity issues under SSA is Children with Special Needs (CWSN). The key thrust of SSA will be on providing inclusive education to all children with special needs in general schools. SSA ensures that every child with special needs, irrespective of the kind, category and degree of disability, is provided quality inclusive education. It will also support a wide range of approaches, options and strategies for education of children with special needs. This includes special training, in the form of school readiness programmes for CWSN, education through special schools, home schooling, community based rehabilitation (CBR). The ultimate aim would be to mainstream all CWSN in neighbourhood schools.3.12.2For effective planning, management and implementation of the of the IE programme, resource groups should be constituted at State and district level. These groups should also have representation from civil societies. A technical person for IE should also be appointed at state/district level. Inclusive education for CWSN under SSA seeks to develop full potentiality of each child with a disability by emphasising on ending all forms of discrimination and promoting effective participation of all. Thus, inclusion of CWSN has to be seen in terms of physical access, social access and quality of access.3.12.3Physical Access: The following activities could be a part of physical access:(i)Mapping of CWSN: Identification/ mapping children with special needs should become an integral part of the micro-planning and household surveys. A concerted drive to detect children with special needs at an early age should be undertaken through PHCs, ICDS, ECCE centres and other school readiness programmes. This must be accompanied by training of the surveyors, enumerators and other government functionaries at different levels.(ii)Assessment of CWSN for mapping of needs: Assessment of each identified child should be carried out. A team should be constituted at the block/ cluster level to carry out this assessment. The assessment team will ascertain the extent and type of the disability, the developmental, level of the child, the nature of support services required, assertive devices required by the child and the most appropriate form of special training to be given to the child.(iii)Educational Placement: Every child with special needs should be placed in the neighbourhood schools, with needed support services. Children with special needs, need to be facilitated to acquire certain skills that will enable them to access elementary education as envisaged in the Act. For instance, they may need mobility training, training in Braille, sign language, postural training, etc. Thus, school preparedness of children with special needs must be ensured by providing 'special training' as envisaged in the RTE Act. This training may be residential, non residential or even home based, as per their specific requirements. The existing non-formal and alternate schooling (including home based education) options for children with disabilities can be recasted as 'special training'. This means that (a) all children with special needs who are not enrolled in schools or have dropped out, will first be enrolled in a neighbourhood school (b) they will be entitled to 'special training' through regular teachers or teachers specifically appointed for. the purpose (c) and then mainstreamed in general schools along with their peers in the age-appropriate class.(iv)Aids and appliances: All children requiring assertive devices should be provided with aids and appliances, obtained as far as possible through convergence with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, State Welfare Departments, National Institutions, ALIMCO, voluntary organisations or NGOs. If aids and appliances cannot be obtained through convergence, then SSA funds could be used for this purpose too.(v)Removal of architectural barriers: Architectural barriers in schools would have to be removed for easy access and to promote inclusion of CWSN. Efforts will be taken to provide all kinds of disabled-friendly facilities in schools and educational institutions. Development of innovative designs for schools to provide an enabling environment for children with special needs should also be a part of the programme. Schools must be designed using an inclusive lens to create barrier-free environments and accessible buildings must incorporate not only through ramps, but also through accessible classrooms, toilets, playgrounds, laboratories etc.3.12.4Quality of Access to CWSN: RTE stresses the importance of preparing and strengthening schools to address all kinds of diversities arising from inequalities of gender, caste, language, culture, religion or disabilities. Hence, to retain CWSN, schools would have to be prepared in terms of support services required by the child, availability of a trained/ sensitised teacher, support from a resource teacher, acceptance by peers and inclusive teaching practices. Elements like classroom space, building, furniture, equipments, seating arrangement, classroom organization, etc would have to be adapted to meet the varied and diverse educational needs of CWSN. For example, space norms would have to be altered for a child with a special need using an assistive device like wheel chair. The components under Quality would include the following:(i)Support services: A continuum of core essential support services is required by CWSN. These services would be category specific and should be made available as per the needs of the child. These support services are essential for the access and retention of CWSN. This would include specific accommodations like availability and upgrading of aids and assistive devices according to individual needs, technological support in the form of augmentative and alternative communication tools, audiovisual material, communication board, computer access, universal design for school buildings, classrooms, transport/ escort facility, furniture and fixtures, resource room support, therapeutical support, text-books in accessible format, ICT support, vocational education and training, etc.(ii)Teacher training: Intensive teacher training should be under taken to sensitise regular teachers on effective classroom management of children with special needs. This training should be recurrent at block/cluster levels and integrated with the on-going in-service teacher training schedules in SSA. All training modules at SCERT, DIET and BRC level should include a suitable component on education of children with special needs.(iii)Resource support: For resource support to CWSN, especially trained special educators should be appointed, particularly for teaching special skills to children with special needs. The resource teacher maybe posted at the block or cluster level and can operate in an itinerant mode, covering a group of schools where children with special needs are enrolled. As far as possible one resource teacher from each category of disability should be appointed at the block level and multi-category training should be provided to all resource teachers to strengthen academic support to CWSN. In case, qualified special teachers as per prescribed qualifications are not available, teachers with short training courses recognised by the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI) may be appointed with the condition that they will complete the full course with in three years of appointment or long term training of regular teachers should be undertaken. IE volunteers should be appointed on contractual basis at cluster/ gram panchayat level from amongst the parents/ family of CWSN and provided intensive training.(iv)Curricular access: The curriculum must be inclusive as envisioned in NCF-2005. It should be ensured that the same curriculum be followed for children with and without special needs, but with minor adaptations like small changes in learning content, learning friendly environment, appropriate learning approach, adaptation in learning aids, flexibility in evaluation, etc. It would be important to provide text books and curriculum in accessible formats for CWSN.(v)Individualized Educational Plan (IEP): An IEP should be prepared for every child with special needs in consultation with parents and experts. Its implementation should be monitored from time to time. The IEP should review the effectiveness of various strategies and support services used by children with special needs periodically, after developing indicators.(vi)Building synergy with special schools: Special schools will have to become resource centres for inclusive education and provide support to IE. The nature of this resource support can cover aspects like teacher training, development of material and appropriate TLMs, providing support services to CWSN, etc. In some cases, special schools can also impart special training to CWSN for a specified period of time and then mainstream into regular schools.(vii)Research: SSA will encourage research in all areas of education of children with special needs including research for designing and developing new assistive devices, teaching aids, special teaching material and other items necessary to give a child with disability equal opportunities in education.3.12.5Social Access to CWSN: Ensuring social access to CWSN is a greater challenge as compared to providing physical access as it requires an in-depth understanding of the various educational needs of CWSN and bringing about attitudinal changes at various levels and providing institutional support to sustain those attitudinal changes. A very important dimension of social access is discrimination. CWSN are subjected to many forms of discrimination. In this context teachers and peers have a very important role to play. Special emphasis must be given to education of girls with disabilities. Social access could include the following:(i)Parental training and community mobilisation. - Parents of children with disabilities should receive counselling and training on how to bring them up and teach them basic survival skills. Strong advocacy and awareness programmes should form a part of strategy to educate every child with special needs. A component on disability should be included in all the modules for parents, VEC and community. School development plans must be developed keeping in mind the needs of CWSN.(ii)Peer sensitisation. - Another group that plays a very crucial role in the context of CWSN is the peer group. Various programmes and curricular and co-curricular activities could be designed for peer sensitisation like inclusive sports, tournaments, cultural programmes, inclusive exposure visits, etc.3.12.6Expenditure upto Rs. 3000/- per disabled child could be incurred in a financial year to meet the special learning needs of such children. The ceiling on expenditure per disabled child will apply at the district level. On-going monitoring and evaluation should be carried out to refine the programme from time to time. For this, appropriate monitoring mechanisms and tools should be devised at every level and field tested at regular intervals.3.13Support for Gender and Social Inclusion

3.14Summing Up3.14.1In SSA, equity means equal opportunity for all children to
complete elementary education irrespective of their gender, religion, caste,
socio-economic, cultural, or linguistic background and geographical location.
It cuts across the components of access, enrolment, retention, participation
and quality. Given that exclusion tends to take highly contextual forms -
varying in scope, form and degree in different parts of the country (and
sometimes within a state too) strategies to achieve equity and inclusion must
come to grips with the local situation within which a particular form of
inequity or exclusion is manifested. Hence, careful situation analysis and
systematic documentation of forms of exclusion would be a necessary starting
point.3.14.2While the RTE Act provides a legal entitlement for children
belonging to disadvantaged groups and communities and weaker sections, their
actual participation will require innovative and sustained measures integrated
with mainstream interventions to ensure meaningful progress on equity. In
order to pursue these measures, SSA would strive to find newer ways of
breaking the barriers that prevent the participation of children from these
backgrounds. Girls do not constitute a homogeneous category, therefore, the
particular challenges of girls within these communities will be highlighted.
Further reality of that children experience multiple form of disadvantage will
in form planning and implementation.3.14.3Government schools cater to most of
the disadvantaged groups and weaker sections and thus, it is important to work
with government agencies on a multi-pronged strategy that includes advocacy,
teacher training, curricular reform as well as community
sensitisation.3.14.4SSA will continue to focus on addressing the needs of
girls, however, the understanding will go beyond that to include a
transformation of gender relations. Gender will be understood as a social
construct that allocates distinct qualities, roles, norms and actions for
boys/ men and girls/women. Thus the strategy for addressing gender concerns
will also include boys. In the context of RTE the importance of the role of
women in SMC's will be taken on board.3.14.5To the extent possible, mainstream
SSA provisions should be applied in a cohesive manner to address equity issues
in a holistic manner and on sustainable basis. Innovative and other
supplementary provisions e.g. residential facility, transportation etc. should
be seen as 'exception' measures in a context specific manner with well defined
deliverables and timelines.3.14.6As issues of quality and equity are
inextricably linked, efforts which are aimed at, one must also include the
other. In the context of implementing RTE, quality concerns- curriculum,
textbooks, teaching-learning materials, the use of space in the classroom,
infrastructure, assessment and teacher trainings for example-will be
highlighted. Further, each of these issues would need to be addressed by a
gender perspective. SSA shall continue to envision and rigorously implement
interventions focusing on curriculum, pedagogy and assessment to address deep
rooted practices of discrimination and prejudice.3.14.7Reaching out to
communities from where the children come will be a key area of SSA
interventions for equity and inclusion. This would! warrant community
participation and ownership in interventions for equity I and inclusion. In
addition, close involvement with other departments as well as with non-
governmental and civil society organisations will also be I a crucial factor
in ensuring universal participation of excluded children.3.14.8SSA will
encourage participation of NGOs and civil society organisations by way of
participatory need assessment, implementation and monitoring. In addition,
these agencies are expected to play a proactive role in advocacy for
children's rights with emphasis on right to education, and, report any
violations.3.14.9. In the case of children without adult protection, lack of
community support and ownership has been a major challenge. To overcome this,
children's own community should be encouraged to mobilise in the form of
'collectives' or 'support groups' and these collectives and support groups
should be given enough space to voice their concerns and participate in
planning, implementing and monitoring interventions for their education. SSA
would encourage States/UTs to partner with NGOs that have relevant experience
to facilitate these initiatives.

### 4. Elementary Education Of Equitable Quality.

\- 4.1 Vision of a Classroom"My vision is of an active classroom, where
students do not merely sit passively taking notes or listening to lectures. My
vision is of a classroom with a buzz of activity. Children are working and
involved, alone or in teams, some supported by peers and some supported by the
teacher. The classroom is full of colour. It is open and inviting, the
atmosphere is charged with energy and enthusiasm; children can be heard
laughing, discussing, debating and arguing.""My vision of a classroom is a
place where there is no discrimination or bias on-grounds of gender, caste or
community, where learning takes place, where self-confidence is built and
exercised, and where personal interactions are nurtured and developed.""My
vision of a classroom is one where children do not hesitate, but do their work
spontaneously and with confidence; where children are not afraid of making
mistakes, and are not afraid to talk to the teacher. They move around freely,
form groups or consult with peers. The teacher helps, observes, supports, and
monitors. Parents and others are in school, talking with children and
teachers. Children and the community have respect for the teacher. Community
members share and discuss problems with the teacher, ask her to solve issues,
and even admire her work."Participants at an SSA WorkshopThe following
statements from the Vision document of a State Plan (Kerala DPEP) also gives
an idea of what we need to transform in our school system to achieve
'quality', which is often spoken of but not necessarily understood in terms of
actual processes.We want to see our classrooms as learning centres where:The
child• gains confidence in facing problematic situations and undertakes tasks
without any hesitation.• interacts freely, meaningfully and joyfully with her
classmates, teachers and teaching learning materials.• interacts in groups and
makes use of other resources for expanding her knowledge.• compares events,
things, facts and findings and arrives at logical conclusions.• assesses her
own progress in her work, identifies errors and rectifies them with the help
off peers, teachers and parents.The teacher• designs and implements activities
taking into consideration the individual differences of each child.•
formulates innovative techniques and practices for the class.• facilitates
activities during classroom interactions as one among the group, without any
inhibition.• sets tasks and gives instructions in accordance with the learning
capability of children.• uses local resources for designing class activities,
and reference materials for updating her knowledge.• elicits regular feedback
and maintains recorded observations to improve her teaching.• takes up
classroom problems as part of action research.• conducts academic discussions
with her colleagues, takes part in collective planning with the School
Resource Group, and inter acts with the community.4.1.1Right to Learn. - We
have had a vision for quality education for all, and now for the first time in
the history of Indian education we have the RTE with a separate Chapter (VI)
to ensure that this vision is implemented. A right framework is a major shift
which implies that the 'compulsion' is on the State to ensure learning of
equitable quality for all children. In the earlier framework, the
responsibility was often placed on the children themselves by labelling them
as 'disinterested' or 'slow learners', or on parents who were assumed to be
'unaware and uneducated'. In fact, Section 8 (c) ensures that children
belonging to weaker sections or disadvantaged groups are not discriminated
against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any
grounds.4.1.2Making this shift is a tremendous challenge for a system which
rests on 'selection' from day one, even before a child can enter school, and
judges a child to be 'slow' or a 'failure' without reminding itself that all
children will learn and develop well in an environment that provides them
quality education. Indeed, the RTE Act requires an emphasis on 'equitable'
quality. Even our earlier policies have stressed that the quality of education
depends on how far it ensures equity; so a system or school that selects
children on the basis of their social advantage, actually compromises on
equity and therefore on 'quality'. Our selective system claims to give
preference to 'merit', and has segregated children into schools of
differential quality on this basis. The so- called most 'able' are selected
for highly resourced 'model' schools. However, the right framework reminds us
that this notion of 'merit' decided by tests is actually connected to social
advantage'. Children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds need greater
attention and the best academic support from a system that promotes 'equitable
quality', not differential quality, through which they are relegated to
impoverished schools and thus, further disadvantaged. Research shows that the
more competitive a test the more it actually selects social advantage, whereas
collaborative and non-threatening assessment of children's progress leads to
better learning of all. This is why the RTE Act (Section 13) has banned any
kind of screening procedure for children and parents at the time of admission,
has barred detention or expulsion of a child, and even disallowed the conduct
of Board examinations till a child completes elementary schooling (class
VIII). This is to give the child adequate time to develop her learning and
understanding fully through an enabling educational environment, and through a
system of continuous and comprehensive assessment which enhances
learning.4.1.3Section 29 of the RTE Act is, therefore, crucial for the design
of an enabling curriculum, by the designated academic authority. The
curriculum here stands for all the components of schooling including in
classroom processes, teacher development programmes, the syllabus and
textbooks, assessment procedures, etc, and is meant to ensure:(a)Conformity
with Constitutional values;(b)all round development of the child;(c)building
up the child's knowledge, potentiality and talent;(d)development of physical
and mental abilities to the fullest extent:(e)learning through activities,
discovery and exploration in a child friendly and child-centred manner;(f)the
child's mother tongue serving 'as far as practicable 'as the medium of
instruction;(g)making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety and helping
the child to express views freely and(h)Comprehensive and continuous
evaluation of the child's understanding and knowledge and the ability to apply
it.4.1.4In this way the principles of child centred education spelt out in the
National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986/92 and elaborated in the NCF - 2005
are now part of educational legislation. Some of these have been included in
various guidelines prepared under Central and State level programmes launched
since the formulation of the NPE, 1986/92, but now need to be strengthened to
ensure implementation of the RTE with in the mandated time."A warm, welcoming
and encouraging approach, in which all concerned share a solicitude for the
needs of the child, is the best motivation for the child to attend school and
learn..The policy of non-detention at the primary stage will be retained,
making evaluation as disaggregated as feasible. Corporal punishment will be
firmly excluded from the educational system and school timings as well as
vacations adjusted to the convenience of children."NPE, 1986/924.2Quality
Concerns in Elementary Education4.2.1Under SSA, most states have included a
variety of interventions for quality improvement. These include pilot
programmes within the Learning Enhancement Programme (LEP), teacher training,
material development, specific subject-oriented programmes, etc. However,
these interventions have sometimes taken the form of add-ons to the existing
learning systems and practices, and have not adequately influenced the
mainstream system, largely for the following reasons:(i)The education system
follows a disjointed approach to curriculum formulation, viewing it score
components of curriculum , syllabus formulation, textbook development, teacher
training, learner assessment, classroom processes and school management as
discrete, fragmented or isolated interventions, rather than inter-connected
and synthesised.(ii)There is a tendency for the system, while formulating the
curriculum, to ignore the ground realities of children, and to espouse
'deficit' theories of learning which assume that children from disadvantaged
backgrounds are also lacking in ability or interest'. For example, the child
may speak a different language at home, may be a first generation school-goer,
may continue to help with domestic chores of the family, but the design and
transaction of the curriculum fails to recognise this and build on it. It is
common for the system to claim that children who come to school at an older
age of say 8 or 9 years 'know nothing' - just because they do not know how to
read and write. This again is a failure of the system to recognise that
children are natural learners and that they bring with them sophisticated
structures of learning and constructing knowledge. Any attempt to improve the
quality of education will succeed only if it goes hand in hand with steps to
promote equality and social justice. This can only be achieved when the
knowledge and experience of children from all backgrounds and particularly
those from disadvantaged groups are fore- fronted in school learning with
primacy to their socio-cultural context.(iii)The education system has adopted
a subject based approach to the organisation of curriculum, focusing on areas
which readily lend themselves to being formulated as 'subjects'. These subject
boundaries have become rigid, are determined more by the disciplines they are
associated with at higher stages of learning, and have little connection with
how children actually develop their conceptual understanding. Moreover, areas
which do not lend themselves to being organised in text books, for example
visual and performing arts or work education, are relegated to 'extra' or 'co-
curricular' activities. Any 'new' concern or problem, such as environmental
awareness, human rights, value education or disaster management, is addressed
piecemeal or as an add-on, without incorporating it cohesively in the
curriculum. The NCF-2005 has called for breaking of these rigid compartments
of conventional subjects to redefine learning areas in line with children's
experiences and learning strategies.(iv)There is an emphasis on reproduction
of 'information' learnt by rote, rather than on 'constructing knowledge' from
experience, which is the natural process for a child's development and
learning.Our schools usually 'transmit information' through lessons
'delivered', where children are expected to passively listen, write or respond
to evaluation tasks on an individual basis. However, children construct
knowledge through collaboration with others, not alone, and the curriculum
design and classroom transaction must ensure this, through the choice of
suitable themes which build on interaction, discussion and group work.(v)Work
on the core components of curriculum is not accompanied by improvement in the
enabling components, which include teacher recruitment and deployment systems,
re-orientation of educational administrators, BRC and CRC faculty.4.3Core
Components of Quality Education4.3.1In dealing with quality concerns in
elementary education, States would need to address the following core
components of Quality Education:4.3.2Appropriate aims of education"The aim of
education is not the acquisition of information, although important, or
acquisition of technical skills, though essential in modern society, but the
development of that bent of mind, that attitude of reason, that spirit of
democracy which will make us responsible citizens"Dr. Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan4.3.2.1There is need for arriving at a relevant, balanced set of
aims describing what learners should learn and why. NCF-2005 identifies
educational aims as comprising:• A commitment to democracy and values of
equality, justice, freedom, concern for others' well being , secularism,
respect for human dignity and rights. Education should aim to build a
commitment to these values, which are based on reason and understanding. The
curriculum should provide adequate experience and space for dialogue and
discourse in the school to build such a commitment in children.• A sensitivity
to others' well-being and feelings, together with knowledge and understanding
of the world should form the basis of a rational commitment to values.• A
capacity to learn and willingness to unlearn and relearn as means of
responding to new situations in a flexible and creative manner.• Appreciation
of beauty and art forms as an integral part of human life.4.3.2.2The aims of
education are expected to reflect the current needs and aspirations of a
society as well as its lasting values. States would need to ensure that the
aims of education are reflected in the curriculum, syllabus, textbooks and
other learning material developed by them.4.3.3. Key Role of Curriculum and
Syllabus:4.3.3.1NCF-2005 lays down the broad principles for the Curriculum
Framework, for the States to design the detailed Curriculum and Syllabus. The
curriculum tells us what is worth teaching, how much should be taught and in
what sequence, with what methods and materials, the linkages across different
aspects of knowledge, how learning should be assessed, teachers prepared, and
how schools monitored.4.3.3.2There has been a general tendency in the system
to load the syllabus of early classes with topics which were earlier
introduced in the secondary and higher secondary classes. This tendency has
been particularly strong in mathematics and science, but it is also fairly
perceptible in the social sciences. The report of the Yash Pal Committee,
Learning without Burden (1993) had pointed out that the burden was from
bombarding children with information that they could not understand at that
age, resulting from an erroneous notion of 'knowledge'. NCF-2005 and the NCERT
syllabi based on it have made an attempt to redress this problem to a certain
extent, but the tendency persists and takes different forms. In j several
states, syllabus revision at the primary stage has not been particularly
radical, and a lot of age-inappropriate material continues to be taught during
the primary classes. The fear that deletion of complex concepts in the early
classes will result in 'dilution' of standards has prevented many States from
taking necessary measures. In many schools, additional and non prescribed
textbooks are used. Some well known private publishers have retained
inappropriate content, which is not in the new syllabus, in their revised
textbooks used by private schools under the claim that these offer more
'advanced' information. When teachers are faced with topics which children
cannot negotiate at a particular age-level, they make children learn by rote
and reproduce those answers in tests and examinations. When children fail to
learn by rote, they are corporally punished or scolded. Poor marks or grades
compel parents to hire a private tutor. RTE has outlawed private tuition as
far as government teachers are concerned. Therefore, to develop meaningful
curricula in keeping with the RTE Act, States need to be guided by the
educational aims discussed above and the following fundamental questions:•
What educational aims and purposes should schools seek to achieve?• Are our
schools achieving these educational purposes?• If not, what alternative
educational experiences can be provided that are likely to achieve these
purposes?4.3.3.3To implement RTE, SSA will provide resource and logistic
support to States to conduct workshops and hold consultations for developing
new curriculum and syllabus.4.3.4Learning in age-appropriate classes. - The
RTE Act (Section 4) stipulates age appropriate admission for out-of-school
children, or those who may have dropped out, so that older children do not
lose self esteem by being made to sit in a designated class of younger
children. The RTE Act, thus, recognises that children do not enter as 'blank
slates' but have rich knowledge from their life experiences which the school
must acknowledge. The Act also provides that such children shall be entitled
to free and compulsory education even after attaining the age of 14 years till
they complete elementary education. Thus, every child has a right to an age-
appropriate education, where she can learn at her own pace for achieving her
full potential. It is in this context that the RTE Act provides for Special
Training for out- of-school children, before being accommodated in an age-
appropriate class. These provisions will result in a special training
heterogeneous class, where children learn from each other and from a sensitive
teacher, who engages them with respect and understanding, in meaningful
learning activities. This special training 'bridge' class, having children of
different ages, will need to sustain the motivation and self esteem of the
older children by creatively using their knowledge to help the younger ones,
and factor in the differential pace of learning by children from diverse
backgrounds and experiences. More importantly, the RTE Act stipulates that all
regular teachers of the school, who need to welcome these children in their
class after their special training is over, will also need Special Training to
understand how to accommodate them without discrimination which makes them
feel 'left out 'or' handicapped' in any ways.4.3.5Subject balance and age-
appropriate syllabi: The goals and aims of curricula must be reflected in the
subjects taught in schools. By and large, there is consensus on the need for a
child centred curricular policy, but in practice, there has been little change
in the content and process of subjects of Language, Mathematics, Science and
Social Sciences over the last two decades. There is need for a consensus
regarding how subjects are defined, how many should be taught at different
stages of education, and the time allocated to each.4.3.5.1The current NCERT
syllabus for Classes I to VIII, prepared based on the NCF-2005, is in
consonance with the formulations of the RTE Act, and marks a major step
forward toward an experiential syllabus design. It was based on the following
principles which need to be included in all the State curricular
interventions:(i)Resonance of the values enshrined in the Constitution of
India(ii)Sensitivity to gender, caste and class parity, peace, health and
needs of children with disabilities(iii)Infusion of environment related and
work based knowledge in all subjects and at all levels(iv)Linkages between
school knowledge in different subjects and children's everyday
experiences(v)Appropriateness of topics and themes for relevant stages of
children's development and continuity from one level to the next(vi)Inter-
disciplinary and thematic linkages between topics listed for different school
subjects, which fall under discrete disciplinary areas(vii)Nurturing aesthetic
sensibility and values by integrating the arts and India's heritage of crafts
in every aspect of the curriculum4.3.6Learning material4.3.6.1Textbook
Contents Reform. - States need to prepare textbooks based on the NCF-2005
principles. Textbook developers would need to design books such as they focus
on the construction of knowledge by learners through the understanding of
concepts, by active exploration, reflective thinking, and by providing
interactive opportunities for children to conduct activities in groups, with
continuous self and peer assessment. The textbooks should keep the principle
of equity and inclusion at the forefront, proactively break extant stereotypes
and reflect sensitivity to gender, caste and class parity, peace, health and
needs of differently abled children. National agencies like NCERT would play a
major role in enhancing the capacity of State agencies to undertake this task,
and helps to sustain academic consultations for a critical review of
curricular initiatives.4.3.6.2While undertaking revision of textbooks it will
be important to rationalise the number of books both at the primary and upper
primary levels such as there is no additional curriculum load on children.
States that follow the seven-rather than eight-year elementary education
cycle, tend to introduce subjects of history, geography, science and social
studies in Class V, rather than Class VI. This adds to the curricular load on
children. There is also need to integrate the various learning materials like
text books, workbooks, worksheets, LEP materials etc. With the purpose of
reducing an unnecessary additional burden on the teacher and child, as well as
bringing in cohesiveness and reducing overlaps. The textbooks should be
designed to nurture an aesthetic sensibility in children. There should be
adequate focus on good quality printing and visual design of books along side
improvement in content. Attention has to be paid for preparation of handbooks
for teachers on new textbooks and the new approach to
curriculum.4.3.6.3Textbook Production Reform. - The textbook production,
encompassing the layout and design, text and cover, paper size and
specifications, ink, printing and binding, etc., have significant implications
for quality. These aspects have so far been relegated to the State Textbook
Boards or SCERTs. SSA will provide support for ensuring reform in the textbook
production process and national consultations to review these issues with
professional artists and designers.4.3.6.4Libraries as learning sites. - The
library will be an essential component of the school, providing not only
resource for learning, but also for strengthening the idea of reading for
pleasure, recreation and further deepening of knowledge and imagination. It
will have newspapers, magazines, books as well as access to new information
technology, including computers wherever possible. Training of teachers in
library management and its usage will be integrated within the teacher
training programmes. The libraries through SSA resources will be created
strictly by the decentralised mechanisms, wherein the wisdom of teachers and
the SMC for procuring books for their children is trusted.Flabby textbooks,
and the syllabi they cover, symbolise a systemic failure to address children
in a child-centred manner. Those who write such encyclopaedic textbooks are
guided by the popular belief that there has been an explosion of knowledge.
Therefore, vast amounts of knowledge should be pushed down the throats of
little children in order to catch up with other countries. Learning without
Burden recommended a major change in the design of syllabi and textbooks, and
also a change in the social ethos, which places stress on children to become
aggressively competitive and exhibit precocity.NCF, 20054.3.6.5Pedagogy. - The
NCF-2005 calls for a constructivist approach to teaching and learning, where
learners make sense of the world around them. This is to be done through
'critical pedagogy' which foregrounds questions of inequality and justice and
enables learners to undertake transformative action.(a)Language. - The vision
of SSA is to enable children to develop language from a social context and use
it for thought and expression in their daily lives. Language teaching cannot
be de-linked from the process of meaning - making and interpreting the
implicit, where culture plays a significant role. Thus, language teaching and
learning should span across the curriculum, in all subject areas and
activities.(b)Social Sciences. - Teaching of Social Sciences should help to
develop an understanding of the socio-political structure of society,
including issues of equity and discrimination. It should be able to situate
these understandings in a historical context rather than presenting them in
fragmented stand alone components. This should converge into every child being
empowered to critically understand one 'sown positioning vis-a-vis others and
developing an attitude to intervene and play a role in transforming the social
order.(c)Sciences. - Like the Social Sciences, Science should develop an
attitude to question what is taken for granted. Teaching of Sciences should
enable every child to understand Science in Everyday life and use activities
of daily life to explain concepts in Science. It should enable children to
question and pursue inquiry in a systematic manner, interpret and analyse. SSA
will support schools for development and procurement of suitable kits and the
establishment of a small laboratory using local resources(d)Mathematics :
Mathematics is a significant area in school education where logical reasoning
and abstract thinking can be developed. However, Mathematics has been a source
of fear among many school going children, despite the fact that they use
Mathematics in daily life to a considerable extent without knowing that they
are doing so. Teaching of Mathematics should incorporate knowledge from e very
day mathematics and folk mathematics, from varied contexts of carpentry,
agriculture, brick making, fishing, architecture, home management, etc. It
should help children develop confidence, an ability to formulate problems they
encounter in their lives and facilitate decision 'making. It is also critical
to relate mathematics to the understanding of social reality, and to
creatively integrate it with other subject areas.(e)Arts and Craft education.
- Art and craft education with special focus on local forms of arts must be
incorporated in the teaching-learning process of all subject areas.(f)Health
and Physical Education. must be an integrated part of schooling at the
elementary level. SSA will support health and physical education at the upper
primary level.(g)Work Education. - The vision of SSA is to enable each child
to understand and gain from the knowledge and dignity of work as part of
education in all subject areas, and not to separate 'manual' from 'mental'
abilities.4.3.6.6Among all these areas, the cross-cutting characteristics will
be that teaching will be based on and make use of local knowledge, experiences
of children, be integrated across subject areas, informed by pedagogical
research, and essentially participatory in nature.4.3.6.7Community knowledge.
- Community is a rich local resource. Every family carries a wide range of
knowledge and skills in the form of stories, songs, poems, riddles, dances,
and occupational knowledge. This local knowledge can provide a rich learning
resource for children. Schools must explore the potential of such learning
resources. NCF-2005 recommends that schools need to relate to children's
knowledge and experiences, and connect classroom knowledge with life outside
the school. Schools need to be nurtured in this spirit, where the teachers
work closely with the community as knowledge partners for effective school
development and management.4.3.7Good use of time. - Research shows consistent
positive correlations between learning time and student achievement. Studies
also show that there is a significant gap between school calendar days,
available school days, and the teachers' physical presence days in the school.
This gap is accounted by teachers involvement in enrolment drives, admissions,
surveys, distribution of textbooks, scholarships etc., as also personal leave,
administrative duties, and official work of other departments, Much time
allocated for instruction is also lost because of teacher and pupil
absenteeism, shortage of classrooms, lack of learning material and weak
discipline. The RTE Act mandates 200 school days at the primary level,
comprising 800 effective schooling hours per year. At the upper primary level
the RTE Act requires 220 school days comprising 1000 hours per year. The RTE
Act also provides that teachers will not be assigned for non-academic work
(barring decennial census, elections and disaster management). Further, it
prohibits teachers from taking private tuition. The Act provides that teachers
should put in 45 working hours per week. This would include time required for
planning and preparation, TLM preparation, transacting the regular time table,
assessment of children's work, providing academic and emotional support to
children who need such support, interaction with the parents and community.
This is expected to improve the teacher's physical presence in the classroom.
However, mere teacher presence in the classroom will not transform student
learning unless it is accompanied by sensitisation for greater learner
oriented pedagogy and classroom organisation.4.3.8Pedagogic approaches for
better learning. - Practitioners broadly agree that teacher-dominated
pedagogy, placing children in a passive role, is undesirable, yet for most
part, this style and method remains the norm. Innovations can be found across
the country, which encourage child-centred, active pedagogy, cooperative
learning and the development of critical thinking and problem- solving skills.
Examples include the curriculum renewal approach of DPEP Kerala, the work of
the Rishi Valley Trust, the 'Nali Kali' programme of Karnataka, the Activity
Based Learning programme of Tamil Nadu, the Hoshangabad Science Teaching
Programme by Eklavya in Madhya Pradesh, or the Integrated Kalikayatna Approach
by Prajayatna in Karnataka.4.3.9Language policy : The choice of language(s)
used in school is of utmost importance for the quality of teaching and
learning. Evidences hows that starting instruction in the learner 's first
language improves learning and cognitive development, and also ensures better
learning of a second language if after a few years, a gradual transition is
made to the second language. Language instruction is a policy choice affecting
curriculum, content and pedagogy.4.3.10Assessment for Learning. - The goals of
assessment are to give learners and teachers a sense of what is being learnt
and how, in order to improve learning and teaching practices. It must show
what progress the child has made with respect to her own performance over
time, and is not meant to compare one child with another. Assessment must
enhance the child's motivation, which is crucial for any learning. In fact,
research now focuses on 'motivation' as the key to better learning rather than
the notion of 'competence'. However, in our prevailing system, the examination
is used to create competition for eliminating children who are found to be
weak on the basis of their poor marks. Once declared 'fail', they either
repeat grade or leave the school altogether. Compelling a child to repeat a
class demotivates and discourages further, without necessarily giving any
special resources to deal with the same syllabus requirements again. Parents
of such children also tend to view them as being fit for failure, thereby
reinforcing the perception which the school has already used for declaring the
child 'fail' on the basis of a three-hour test. The prevailing examination
system treats evaluation as a means of judging and passing a verdict. Such a
practice is incompatible with the concept of child-centred education in a
rights framework, and has been prohibited through the provision of 'No
Detention' under the RTE Act.4.3.10.1RTE provides for Comprehensive and
Continuous Evaluation (CCE). CCE essentially means that assessment should be
treated as an integral part of teaching and learning, through observations of
children and maintaining records of their work done in a portfolio, rather
than as a judgement. More importantly, efforts should be made to give self
assessment exercises to learners, so that they can creatively articulate what.
they can do and what they need support for, as is effectively done in
progressive interventions even with young children. With the formulation of
RTE, evaluation in any form, including examination, cannot be treated as a
basis for stopping a child from progressing to the next Class.4.4Enabling
Components of Quality Education4.4.1Pre-school or Early Childhood Care and
Education (ECCE): The National Policy of Education (NPE) gives importance to
Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) as a crucial input for human
resource development, as a feeder and support programme for primary education
and as a support service for working women of the disadvantaged sections of
society. It has also taken into account the holistic nature of ECCE and has
pointed out the need for early care and stimulation of children belonging to
the vulnerable sector. The potential of ECCE as an intervention for girls'
education is widely recognised as an essential input in freeing girls from
sibling care responsibilities, leading to their regular attendance in school
and in providing school readiness skills to pre-school children.4.4.1.1Section
11 of the RTE Act, 2009 makes provision for being engaged with pre-school
education. It states:"With a view to prepare children above the age of three
years for elementary education and to provide early childhood care and
education for all children until they complete the age of six years, the
appropriate Government may make necessary arrangement for providing free pre-
school education for such children".4.4.1.2This allows for the necessary space
within the ambit of the RTE Act to enable a greater degree of involvement in
the pre-school segment of education.Continuous evaluation. - Modem educational
theory has battled with such obsolete practices of examinations for a long
time. Its message is simple and clear: namely that children's learning and
development cannot be viewed in terms of a rigidly defined class structure,
nor it can be fitted into an annual cycle of evaluation and promotion. The RTE
Act represents the legal approval of modem educational thinking when the Act
prohibits detention and requires that a child can join the school at any point
in the year. The vision underlying the RTE Act is further clarified by the
prohibition imposed on Board examination at the end of the elementary stage or
before it. This vision is completely consistent with NCF which also recommends
that there should be no Board examination at any point in elementary
education. 'Continuous Evaluation' means that the teacher's work should be
continuously guided by the child's response and participation in classroom
activities. In other words, evaluation should be seen as a process whereby the
teacher learns about the child in order to be able to teach better, and
'Continuous Evaluation' becomes a strategy of assessment which is a part and
parcel of teaching itself.Comprehensive evaluation. - The term 'Comprehensive'
implies the capacity to view the child from a holistic perspective, rather
than merely in terms of a learner of different school subjects. A
comprehensive evaluation strategy would imply that aspects such as the child's
health, self image, sensibilities, etc. are also perceived in the context of
development and growth. Conventionally these aspects are either neglected in
our education system or as we now see in private schools, dealt with by using
an arbitrarily devised grading system which conveys the impression that the
teacher has judged the child according to a norm. It is the duty of the
teacher to make every possible effort, through interaction and engagement, to
observe and understand the child's own nature. It is also important that the
teacher does not judge the child's nature. Rather, what is required is that
the teacher notices the inherent potential of the child as a learner in the
context of his or her nature. Training for careful observation and record-
keeping will have to be organised and executed in a careful and academically
sound manner, to enable teachers to fulfil the expectation of the RTE Act. For
guiding teachers to observe a child's behaviour and attitude, a new initiative
will have to be taken for developing relevant material which can serve as a
basis for training programmes.Report of the Committee on Implementation of RTE
and Consequent Revamp of SSA. - 4.4.1.3 SSA realises the importance of pre-
school learning and early childhood care and its role in improving
participation of children in schools. In order to.facilitate a greater
convergence with ICDS, efforts to strengthen it in the area of pre-school
education will be made.4.4.1.4In habitations not covered by Integrated Child
Development Services (ICDS) and wherever the State Government is desirous of
starting a pre-school education centre in the formal primary school, SSA
support could be accessed through funds available under the head-innovative
Activities. In case of a new ICDS centre coming in such a habitation, the pre-
school facility will necessarily have to work in conjunction with the ICDS.
Since ICDS is the main scheme for early childhood care and education, SSA will
extend support only to enable the ICDS to enrich and sustain its pre- school
and school preparedness component. When ICDS universalises its reach and
coverage for pre-school education and school readiness, SSA support will cease
in order to avoid any duplication.4.4.1.5SSA emphasises the importance of ECCE
by strengthening convergence with the ICDS programme of Ministry of Women &
Child Development to promote pre-school education. SSA would strive to
maintain effective synergy with the ICDS through the following:(i)Convergence
instructions to be issued by State Education Departments in concurrence with
ICDS Department.(ii)Regular inter departmental meetings at the State, district
and block level between SSA official and the ICDS
programme.(iii)Representative of ICDS programme on the State Level Executive
Committee of SSA and District Implementation Committee.(iv)Location of
Anganwadi centres in or close proximity to primary school campus and
synchronisation of the timings of the Anganwadi centres with the primary
schools.(v)Joint efforts for curriculum renewal of nursery teacher training
and conduct of trainings of Anganwadi workers, primary teachers and health
workers for a convergent understanding of links between learning and
development in pre-school and primary school.(vi)Use of infrastructure of
DIETs, BRCs and CRCs for training of Anganwadi workers and other functionaries
of ICDS.(vii)Strengthening of training of Anganwadi workers in pre-school
activities in both existing and new projects/Anganwadi
centers.(viii)Augmentation of pre-school kits/materials in Anganwadis, where
such materials are required.4.4.2. Teachers. - SSA visualises teacher as a
capable facilitator, who motivates children to construct their own knowledge.
The teacher should be aware about progressive pedagogy and must know the
nature and experiences of children from various social and cultural
backgrounds. Moreover, RTE requires that teachers should be committed to
equity and social justice, aware about child entitlements and convinced that
all children can learn well if provided education of equitable
quality.4.4.2.1Teacher Recruitment, Placement and Training. - The RTE Act
recognises the importance of providing adequate number of teachers and lays
down that the prescribed Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) must be maintained for each
school. It also recognises the need for subject specific teachers, head
teacher and part time instructors for art, health and work education in upper
primary schools. [In addition, it stipulates that no school shall have a
teacher vacancy of more than 10%] [Notification No F 1-4/2010-EE.4 dated 22nd
June 2010 on implementation of section 25(1) of the RTE Act clarifying the
time frame to complete the recruitment process is attached at Annexure 10.]
SSA will support States in recruiting adequate number of teachers in the new
schools sanctioned under the programme as well as additional teachers to meet
the requirements of PTR at school level as per norms.4.4.2.2While calculating
the requirement of additional teachers, the enrollment, population projections
and State vacancies will be considered. The practice of recruiting at least
50% women teachers will continue. The sharing arrangement for teacher salary
will be in accordance with the fund sharing pattern between Centre and States.
SSA assistance will not be available for filling up State vacancies that have
arisen on account of attrition.4.4.3Teacher Re-deployment : The RTE
stipulation that PTR shall be maintained in respect of each school and that no
school shall have teacher vacancies exceeding 10% warrants immediate
intervention for re-deployment of surplus teachers to schools where the PTRs
exceed the RTE stipulations. It is suggested that States undertake a rational
re-deployment of teachers to ensure that the RTE stipulations are adhered
to.4.4.4Teacher Qualifications. - The RTE Act, 2009 under Section 23(1)
provides for minimum qualification of a teacher as laid down by academic
authority, authorised by the central government by notification. Accordingly
the Central Government has notified National Council for Teacher Education
(NCTE) as the [academic authority] [Notification authorizing NCTE as the
academic authority for Teacher Qualifications is at Annexure 11.] to lay down
the minimum qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as a
teacher.4.4.5The following Teacher Qualifications laid down by the NCTE under
section 23 of the RTE Act, would need to be followed in all future
recruitments.Redeployment of teachers. - There is clearly a need to evolve a
more transparent system of transfers and re-deployment of teachers-a system
which is both child centered and teacher friendly. The implementation of the
computerised system for fresh postings, transfers and re-deployment would help
the States in maintaining school-wise Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) as stipulated
under RTE in a transparent manner. The TSG has developed computerised software
for the use of States. The software uses the DISE database and can:• generate
a list of under-served and over-served schools.• create a vacancy database.•
generate a list of vacancies subject-wise.• be sensitive to the needs of
physically handicapped teachers, women teachers and other categories as
prioritised by the State.• correct existing imbalances in teacher deployment.•
be customised to State needs.4.4.6Training of Untrained teachers. - The RTE
Act attaches immense significance to the role of teachers in improving
elementary education by making available professionally trained teachers for
the school system. It provides a time frame of five years for ensuring that
all teachers in [elementary schools are professionally trained] [Notification
No F 1-3/2010-EE.4 dated 9th November 2010 on the implementation of the
provisions of section 23(2) of the RTE Act to grant relaxation in minimum
qualification for appointment as a teacher is attached at Annexure 13.].
Within this period, all teachers would need to acquire the academic and
professional qualifications prescribed by the academic authority under the RTE
Act. In this context, NCTE has provided that teachers appointed prior to the
NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualifications for Recruitment of Teachers in
Schools) Regulations, 2001 dated 3 September 2001, need not acquire the
revised teacher education qualifications. A teacher appointed on or after 3
September-2001 would require Senior Secondary and D. Ed (two years) or Senior
Secondary and B.El.Ed (4 years) for teaching at the primary stage of
education. For teaching at the upper primary stage a teacher would require (a)
Senior Secondary and D.Ed (two years) or (b) Senior Secondary and B.El.Ed (4
years), (c) Graduation with B.Ed (one year). States may make an assessment of
the teachers requiring academic and professional qualifications as per the

pedagogically empowered teacher.

4.4.7Pre-Service Training for Teachers. - Teacher preparation is very
essential for quality improvement. It will be important to ensure that pre-
service training is strengthened with the help of inspiring teacher trainers.
Opportunities for the professional development of teachers have to be
encouraged and all efforts to provide effective pre-service and in-service
training and induction have to be made to attain the objectives of quality
education. SSA will converge with the Teacher Education Scheme such that
teacher preparation as per district attrition can be ensured. For ensuring
academic and professional qualification within a stipulated time frame, SSA
will provide resources and organise training of untrained teacher leading to
prescribed certification.Curricular Areas : Two-year D. Ed ProgrammeChild

School Internship4.4.8In-service Training for Teachers. - In addition, the
programme will support annual in-service training of teachers, to enable them
to continuously upgrade their knowledge and teaching skills. In-service
teacher training should facilitate a shift in the understanding of teaching
and learning, as stipulated by the RTE Act and NCF 2005:

To Enact Shift in Perspectives and Practices  
---  
From | To  
Teacher directed fixed designs | Learner-centric, flexible processes  
Learner receptivity | Learner agency, participation in learning  
Knowledge as "given", fixed | Knowledge as constructed involving  
Learning as an individual act | Learning as a collaborative, social process  
Disciplinary focus | Multidisciplinary, educational focus  
Assessment judgemental, mainly throughcompetitive tests for ranking, through narrow measures ofachievement, leading to trauma and anxiety |  Assessment for Learning, self assessment toenhance motivation, through continuous non-threatening processes,to record progress over time.  
  
4.4.8.1The Teacher Training plan must be developed on the basis of the
following processes:• Identification of teacher training needs• Annual review
of teacher training module/package to avoid repetition Long term and
sustainable plan for preparation of master trainer• Research and development
for teacher training - development of teacher friendly reading materials about
child development and children's knowledge, community knowledge and latest
developments in pedagogy4.4.8.2The States will be encouraged to draw up a long
term in-service teacher development plan, defining parameters such as the
periodicity, content and methodology of the programmes. The training design
will be such that it integrates content, pedagogy, material development and
resources and phased to incorporate time in schools for their own reflective
practice through projects. This will be followed through adequate follow up
support at the block and cluster level. Arrangements for classroom observation
after training programmes by the Resource Persons will be encouraged. The
cluster level meetings will develop into a professional forum for teachers to
reflect and plan together. This would bed one in a decentralised and
consultative manner.4.4.9Academic Support and Supervision: District Institutes
of Education and Training (DIETs), Block Resource Centres (BRCs)/ Urban
Resource Centres (URCs) and Cluster Resource Centres (CRCs) have been
conceptualised to function as academic resource centers. The faculty in DIETs
provide pre-service and in- service training. The coordinators in BRCs and
CRCs provide in-service training and on-site support to schools for
improvement of school quality. It is highly desirable that positions in these
institutions are created for a long term commitment and that the present
practice of short-term deputations to teachers, especially in BRCs and CRCs,
is discontinued.4.4.9.1The major role of DIETs should be to(a)provide academic
support and undertake capacity building of BRC/ CRCs.(b)develop contextual
training modules taking local knowledge and resources into
consideration.(c)develop exemplar material and activities for child-centred
classroom transaction with due consideration to age, equity and socio-cultural
diversity of children.(d)strengthen community, school, teacher and CRC
linkages.(e)conduct periodical research on the impact of the teacher training
and effectiveness in the classrooms to make amends accordingly.4.4.9.2The
major role of BRCs should be to(a)function as a repository of academic
resources including ICT, science & math kits, teaching learning resource
material in different curricular areas, including pre-school material, and
material for children with special needs;(b)maintain and constantly update
databases of education experts from nearby Teacher Education institutions,
NGOs, Colleges/ Universities who could participate in Resource Groups for
different subject areas and themes;(c)ensure regular school visits and on-site
academic support to address pedagogic issues and other issues related to
school development;(d)organise in-service teacher training based on teacher
needs as observed during school visits;(e)participate in monthly teacher
meetings organised at the cluster resource centres to discuss academic issues
and to design strategies for better school performance;(f)consult with school
management committee, community members and local authority for formulating
school development plans; and(g)design a comprehensive quality improvement
plan for the block/cluster and implement it in a time bound manner.4.4.9.3The
major role of CRCs should be to(a)function as academic resource centers with
adequate resource/ reference materials for concerned teachers;(b)undertake
regular school visits and provide onsite academic support to
teachers;(c)organise monthly meetings to discuss academic issues and design
strategies for better school performance.(d)visit and hold meetings with
members of the SMCs and other local bodies for school improvement, support SMC
in school development plan(e)ensure that the special training programmes are
properly designed and implemented in the cluster for out-of-school children
and securing their admission to age-appropriate classes.4.4.9.4The RTE Act
mandates provision of training facilities as well as good quality education.
The BRCs and CRCs are the most critical units for providing training and on-
site support to schools and teachers. Given the significance of these
structures, SSA will strengthen faculty and infrastructure support to
BRC/CRC.4.4.9.5To improve the effectiveness of the block/cluster coordinators,
there will be a focus on improved selection criteria, which takes into
consideration experience, qualifications and aptitude for training and
research. There will also be focus on constant skill enhancement through
appropriate training programmes that will help Resource Persons grow into
teacher mentors-cum-educators. Functional linkages of BRCs and CRCs with DIETs
and district level resource groups will be strengthened.4.4.10Training for
administrative and academic support4.4.10.1For Head Teachers. - School is the
place where the provisions of the RTE Act have to unfold and children receive
their entitlements. RTE demands new skills and a broadened perspective among
Head Teachers for looking at school functioning from the point of view of
children's rights which need to be protected every day in the school.
Questions that need to be addressed on a daily basis include:• Does the school
function regularly for the specified number of hours and the number of days in
the year?• Do teachers attend regularly?• Are children taught courses as per
the prescribed curriculum?• Are they assessed continuously? Are teachers
maintaining a record of their work and progress, which is regularly shared
with them and their parents?• Are children treated in a manner that
corresponds to the requirements of the Act such as no physical punishment,
trauma or mental harassment, equal treatment to all children without any
discrimination?• Is the school inclusive for differently abled children and do
children needing special help receive appropriate support?4.4.10.1.1As an
educational professional, the Head Teacher needs training for providing
academic support to teachers in the school. The Head Teacher must also be
trained in leadership so that she/he can play be a democratic and natural
leader, not because of the position she/he holds, but because of her/ his
ability to administer a school where there is no discrimination or bias on
grounds of gender, caste or community. The Head Teacher needs training in the
basics of finance in order to maintain accounts relating to (a) school grants,
(b) teacher grants, (c) maintenance grants, (d) construction works, (e) mid-
day meals, etc. She/he needs training in the administration of departmental
programmes and schemes. A key training input should be in human relationships
- school and community, school and educational administrators, teachers and
students, teachers and parents, teachers and teachers.4.4.10.1.2Training for
Head Teachers would include the following components. - (a) orientation to the
various sections of the RTE Act which directly relate to school functioning;
(b) orientation on emotional aspects to ensure that children, who have been
mainstreamed into age-appropriate classes are supported; (c) keeping up-to-
date records of teacher and student participation in various activities; (d)
dealing with children with special needs; and (e) academic and human resource
management.4.4.10.2For Educational Administrators: The RTE Act places new
responsibilities on Educational Administrators to ensure that the provisions
of the Act are implemented. A key reform in training would be to change the in
spectorial role of the educational administrator to that of a mentor.
Educational Administrators need training for (a) ensuring that financial,
social, cultural, linguistic and procedural barriers do not come in the way of
children accessing and completing elementary education, (b) undertaking
periodic supervision of schools to observe the infrastructure, facilities, use
of teaching learning material, and other administrative aspects, (c)
operationalising the school syllabi, teaching learning process and learner
assessment system, (d) developing a proper system of academic and curricular
support to serve the purpose of continuing professional upgradation of
teachers.4.4.10:2.1 Educational Administrators need training on managing (a)
the human element, (b) the curricular aspects and (c) material resources. In
the human element the Educational Administrators need to have the ability to
deal with complex issues such as teacher recruitment and rationale deployment,
teacher and student absenteeism, teacher motivation and discipline, and
teacher skill enhancement. Curricular aspects of training for Educational
Administrators would entail an understanding of the child centred curriculum
enunciated in section 29 of the RTE Act. The administration and management of
material resources and the efficient administration of government schemes
requires organisational and managerial skills would include training for
management of mid-day meal, textbook and uniform distribution, ensuring
interface of the schools with the local community and upgrading their
knowledge on government schemes and programmes.4.4.10.3Academic Authorities :
will be responsible to specify and develop curriculum, syllabus and textbooks
in line with the NCF-2005 and taking all the considerations of RTE
implications promoting a child centred critical pedagogy and active classroom
processes. The academic authority will evolve a good pool of resource persons
involving academics, members from civil society, NGOs, artisans, professionals
from art and culture, media, etc.4.4.10.4For Community Members: The RTE Act
attaches immense importance to the School Management Committees. The SMCs will
provide the support system to ensure that provisions pertaining to duties of
the teacher as well as prohibition of private tuition are fulfilled. It will
also monitor that teachers are not burdened with non academic duties and that
steps for adherence to the schedule of the RTE Act are taken. While making
school development plan, apart from requirement for infrastructure needs,
adequate attention has to be paid to quality issues including teacher
training, availability of child entitlements, teaching learning materials in
schools, pupil assessment methods and preparation of pupil cumulative record.
The SMC can also act as a bridge for community involvement in sharing
knowledge with school children. This shift in focus should also result in a
greater involvement of the community with the school, for sharing of local
knowledge and traditional wisdom. Integrating work with education across the
curriculum would require the attachment of children with professionals,
farmers, and artisans. In addition, there should be greater involvement with
various extension workers i.e. agriculture, health, anganwadi workers for more
experiential learning. In this effort of monitoring quality, the role of
community assumes paramount significance. The community leaders and groups
need to be sensitised on issues related to monitoring of children's progress
and other quality related school activities.4.4.11Research. - Research plays
an important role in assessing and monitoring the progress in elementary
education. Research and evaluation studies are undertaken at national, state,
district level and may also be conducted at the block, cluster and school
level in the form of Action Research for providing greater insight into issues
and problems faced in implementation of the various components of SSA at
different levels. The findings of research studies would help in more
systematic planning the inputs and strategies for SSA. Apart from evaluation
of the inputs and how the programme is being implemented, research would also
include evaluation of outcomes and impact of interventions provided for
specific purposes under SSA and for RTE.4.4.11.1States should give priority to
developing and implementing, research projects concerned with quality related
issues, such as estimating out-of-school children; status and effectiveness of
Special training centres; Completion rate/Dropout rate and Transition Rate;
assessing state's curriculum in the light of NCF-2005; students' learning
outcomes; student's and teachers' attendance rates: effectiveness of teacher
training: efficacy of text books and other TLM quality of academic supervision
provided by BRCs/CRCs/ DIETs; discriminatory practices in schools, teaching-
learning in class rooms ; implementation of CCE in schools; role of SMCs in
school management, etc. The priority areas of research at the state level and
district level should be decided by the Resource Groups or Research Advisory
Committees at those levels.4.4.11.2At the national level, apart from TSG,
NCERT, NUEPA, IGNOU and other Universities, research institutions and NGOs
should be involved in research projects concerned with SSA and RTE. In the
states, involvement of SCERT, SIEMAT and DIETs, universities and State
Research institutions should be encouraged in conducting research on issues of
relevance to SSA and RTE. It is important that the findings of research are
widely disseminated and used in planning and improvement of various
interventions.4.4.12Under the Innovation, Head SSA provides support for
Computer Aided Learning (CAL) facilities upto ' 50 lakhs per district per
year. The focus of CAL will be to maximise coverage in Upper Primary Schools
with special emphasis on Science and Mathematics. Hardware, software,
training, maintenance and resource support if required, could inter alia be
included in this component.4.5Other Essential Components of Quality
Education4.5.1The RTE Act enumerates some specific ways in which the school
environment can be made stress free for the child. These include:4.5.2No
corporal punishment or mental harassment. - The Act bans physical punishment
and mental harassment. There is a mistaken notion that 'discipline' of
children comes from punishment and fear. However, educationists the world-over
are clear that what matters to creating a mature citizen is the provision of a
democratic 'learning environment' in the form a nurturing school, and not a
'correctional' centre. Physical punishment and mental trauma are counter-
productive, and may cause a child to become even more defiant and rebellious
than before. Children's bodies are tender and vulnerable. There are many
examples of grievous injury to children on account of physical punishment.
Even a minor punishment can result in an injury - both physical and emotional
- a slap may result in a child going deaf and being humiliated. Any kind of
physical punishment and mental trauma is potentially unsafe and injurious to
health, and violative of the child's rights.4.5.3No detention. - The 'no
detention policy' does not imply abandoning procedures that assess children's
learning; in fact it implies putting in place a continuous and comprehensive
procedure of child assessment and records, The RTE Act calls for setting up of
such continuous and comprehensive system of Constitution of India evaluation
that releases the child from the fear and trauma of failure, but enables the
teacher to pay individual attention to children's learning and
performance.4.5.4No expulsion. - The implications of 'expulsion' are that the
education system has refused to serve the child. The notion of expulsion is
not compatible with the concept of 'right'. No civilised country expels
children from elementary schools, for any reason; there are no 'valid' grounds
for doing so. If a child does not respond to the existing system and resort s
to 'deviant 'activities, then the education system must address the child
differently - through counselling or by providing different curricular and co-
curricular experiences and activities, which enable the child to develop self
awareness, address deep rooted fears or problems, and consequently help change
patterns of behaviour.Constitution of IndiaArt 39 (e): The state shall ensure
that the tender age of children are not abusedArt 39 (f): The state shall
ensure that children are given opportunities to develop in a healthy manner
and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are
protected against exploitation and against moral and material
abandonment.There is explicit use of the word 'dignity' in Article 39(f); RTE
acknowledges that dignity and punishment cannot co-exist.United Nations
Convention on Child Rights (UNCRC).Article 19: State parties shall take all
appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to
protect the child form all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or
abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including
sexual abuse, while in the care of parents, legal guardians or any other
person who has the care of the child.4.6Summing Up4.6.1It is clear that school
quality enhancement requires systemic reform in elementary education for
translating this vision of quality into the lived experience of all children
in elementary schools. States/UTs are .required to frame appropriate rules
under the RTE Act. These may be followed up with appropriate executive
instructions and training to all education administrators and teachers at
different levels. Many of the interventions, such as issuing orders for
anytime enrolment throughout the academic year; banning physical punishment;
no denial of admission on grounds of screening, or for want of transfer or
birth certificates etc., have no financial implications under SSA or the State
sector programmes. However, they are an important part of the systemic reforms
mandated under the SSA programme to implement the RTE Act, and must be
included in the overall school quality improvement plan under the programme.

### 5\. Participation And Role Of Community And Civil Society.

. - 5.1 Background5.1.1It would be impossible for RTE as well as SSA to succeed without people's support and ownership. The RTE mandate for age-appropriate admission of every out-of-school child, special training for each child to enable her to cope in school, promoting child-friendly child centered and activity' based learning processes, which is free of anxiety, trauma and fear sets the agenda for proactive community participation.5.1.2Community participation would be a central and overarching factor in planning, implementation and monitoring interventions for universal elementary education. SSA would work towards enhancing participation of the community, parents, teachers and children by awareness generation and interventions for community mobilisation. To facilitate such a massive mobilisation and solicit active participation, State and District SSA Offices would need to join hands with experienced and active civil society organisations.5.2Role of Civil Society Organisations and the Nature of their Engagement5.2.1The importance of the role of civil society organisations with relevant and demonstrated experience at different levels and locations, in translating RTE from a legal framework on paper to a vibrant movement on the ground, cannot be overstated. This becomes even more critical in the face of the scale of the task and the myriad challenges that are envisaged in ensuring the proper implementation of the Act. The civil society, therefore, need to be viewed as partners in implementation of the RTE Act. NGOs have always been considered as the principal agency of the civil society. In recent years the number of NGOs has increased phenomenally. For selection of partner NGOs it would be necessary to make a cautious selection. But once it is decided to establish a relationship) of partnership with an NGO and the area of that NGO's engagement is decided, necessary support should be provided to the selected NGO. Ordinarily, there need be no hesitation in transferring to the NGO the patterned budget for the selected area of implementation.5.2.2Civil society organisations have had a long history of involvement in the education sector to which they have significantly contributed in variety of ways. There are also several examples of effective partnership and collaboration between government and civil society. However, the relationship between civil society and the State is complex and partnerships have not always been a smooth sailing. Over the years, the space for NGO/civil society intervention has tended to get limited taking on implementation of particular projects. Partnerships have tended to be short-term and ad hoc rather than holistic and ongoing engagement.5.2.3For SSA to be effectively implemented, the space for genuine long-term partnerships based on mutual respect must be evolved. Critical to ensuring this would be to legitimise and institutionalise the different roles of NGOs within the institutional and other mechanisms that will be put in place. In other words, the engagement of civil society needs to be systemic and not project driven. Partnerships should be comprehensive with scop>e for NGOs to take overall responsibility for ensuring implementation of the Act.5.2.4SSA should review the nature of its engagement with NGOs and initiate a process of dialogue to open up new areas of collaboration in keeping with the parameters of the Act. Areas where partnerships have worked well should be continued; taking into cognizance the new realities thrown up by the Act, fresh areas of partnership explored. An example, of the former wouH be the running of bridge courses, which in many states have been considered anare a of successful partnership. The central scheme for assistance to voluntary organizations us attached1#. It would be advisable for State Governments to develop similar schemes.# The scheme for assistance for experimental ami innovative component of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan/RTE at the elementary level is attached at Annexure 14.5.2.5NGOs would also have to re-think their roles in the light of RTE. NGO interventions like the running of alternative schools, programmes for out-of school children, NFE centres would need to be recast. For instance, the Act specifies that the responsibility of providing special trainings (for age-appropriate enrolment) would rest with the school/local authorities. NGOs, CBOs, etc working in this area would now necessarily have to work in close collaboration with these institutions and within the framework of RTE. Trustworthy NGOs exist in most parts of the country. There are some, who have built a reputation. Those NGOs are likely to be natural partners, after their credentials are verified. Several NGOs are not well-known but are good and dependable and have considerable capacity, which should be harnessed. For effective implementation of RTE, efforts should be made to bring in grass roots organisations with proven experience to implement and monitor implementation of the Act. Over the last couple of decades we have witnessed a process of grassroots institution building. Mahila Samoohs, Sangathans, SHGs, Mahila Samakhya federations, youth groups, groups working for people's rights, etc. have been formed and some of these have developed substantial capacities and have empowered members. It would be useful to mobilise the support of these grassroots formations.5.2.6The role of the local authority has been clearly outlined in the Act. Expectations from the local authorities are considerable and challenging. Long-term partnerships between NGOs and Panchayati Raj (PRIs) would therefore be required to enable local authorities to meet these challenges. Organisations working with PRIs since the passing of the 73 and 74 Amendments, who may not necessarily have experience of working in education should also be brought in.5.2.7While advocating for the inclusion of a broad spectrum of organisations care must be taken to ensure that organisations that uphold the spirit of the Act, adhere to constitutional values and are committed to a relation of partnership with government are enabled to get involved. Thus, proper screening criteria and processes must be put in place.5.3Potential Areas of Partnership5.3.1While it is agreed that the role of civil society needs to be holistic, there are some areas, where NGOs and other civil society organisations could play a substantial role. These are:5.3.2Mobilisation and awareness building. - Often one notices widespread cynicism towards a new government initiative. People can be heard voicing a feeling that the RTE Act would have the same fate as several other laws enacted to bring about reform. Therefore, it is a matter of greatest importance that conviction is built among media, intelligentsia and the masses that not only is government totally committed to ensure implementation of this law, teachers and general public would not any more tolerate the status quo in education and that through collective efforts we shall bring about a real change. A massive mobilisation would be required to build awareness around the Act and to enable the community to monitor and demand accountability. Building a vibrant campaign to generate a momentum and a broad-based awareness of the provisions of the Act would be a crucial contribution of civil society organisations. Mobilisation and awareness building cannot be considered as a one-time activity and will have to be sustained. Thus civil society organisations would have to take this up as a challenge. Lessons from the nation-wide upsurge created during the National Literacy Mission (NLM) can also be drawn upon to develop the campaign.5.3.3Social mapping. - The most important resource of any community is its local wisdom and knowledge. Social mapping enables the community to harness their local wisdom and knowledge to identify their educational needs and problems, based on which they can formulate and implement School Development Plan and also monitor and evaluate the whole process. In this regard the role of the NGO would, mainly, be to undertake thorough survey to ensure that no families get left out and necessary details regarding the school are carefully listed.5.3.4Resource support. - Effective implementation of the Act will require expertise at different levels from the local to the national and from a range of organisations, depending on their areas of expertise. Areas where resource support and capacity building can be provided by civil society organisations would include:• complementing government's capacity for teacher training;• curriculum and pedagogy as mentioned• in the following sub-paragraph; and• continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation being a crucial aspect of the new approach to educational reform, and keeping in view the fact that there is insufficient experience in this area, help could be taken from NGOs with special capability.5.3.5Development of curriculum and pedagogySome civil society organisations have developed an expertise after years of innovation, experimentation and validation at the ground level, in several core areas outlined in the Act. Involvement of groups and organisations with such experience should be facilitated to provide inputs in the following areas:(i)Curriculum development, particularly of bridge courses, which would be important in implementing the provision of age appropriate enrolment,(ii)Development of teacher training strategies(iii)Design of evaluation mechanisms (CCE)(iv)Research5.3.6Ensuring equity, quality and non-discrimination: The Act outlines critical issues related to quality, equity and the need to ensure that the educational space is discrimination free. Thus, NGOs and civil society organisations could have a crucial role to play not just in reporting violations but also building a perspective on gender and social inclusion Issues and ensuring that these become integral cross-cutting concerns informing different aspects - for example, training, curriculum and classroom transactions, performance of SMCs, etc.5.3.7Training of School Management Committees: This would be an important area of NGO involvement. The Act clearly outlines the functions to be performed by SMCs. Some of these functions, for example, preparation of school development plans, would require significant investments in capacity building. Past experience has shown that mere setting up of committees does not ensure their meaningful participation in programmes. Moreover/although provision is made in membership of these committees for inclusion of women and persons from disadvantaged communities, in reality, they are excluded from decision-making processes. Therefore, the role of civil society organisations would be critical in making the SMCs an effective democratic space. It needs to be highlighted that the nature of such interventions cannot be one- time training but must necessarily be a long-term involvement.5.3.8Training of personnel of Panchayati Raj InstitutionsPRIs will have to play a crucial role in provision of facilities mentioned in the Act. They are also the first level to be addressed by persons aggrieved about denial of right to education as written in the Act. Therefore, training of PRI personnel will be a challenging task. A large number of NGOs and CBOs have experience in the training of PRI personnel. District authorities will have to prepare a comprehensive plan for training and re- training of these personnel. It would be advisable to assign appropriate responsibility to NGOs /CBOs wherever suitable ones are available.5.3.9Conduct of 'Special Training'It is laid down in the Act that all out-of-school children should be admitted in an age-appropriate class and provided 'special training' to enable them to keep pace with other students. Past experience shows that 'special training' can prepare the students much better if it is residential. Wherever possible, it would be advisable to incorporate a component of life-skills training in this residential education programme. From the point of view of future development of children, this 'special training' will be of immense importance and should be undertaken after sufficient preparation. Generally speaking, it would be necessary to develop appropriate curriculum and instructional methods for this purpose. Considering the complexities and enormity of this work all agencies which have the willingness and the ability to undertake this work must be encouraged to do so. Several NGOs have experience and /or ability to work in this area and they would be the natural partners in implementation of this aspect of the RTE Act.5.3.10Area based responsibilityIt is essential that accomplish ability of the provisions of RTE Act and the Rules framed thereunder is demonstrated in practically all parts of the country in the shortest possible time. State Governments and local authorities would, no doubt, attempt to make a concerted effort in selected areas - that would serve as pilots to motivate and impel others. NGOs can serve as an effective agency to initiate this step and to sustain it till full impact of the Act is realised. This could be in a block, a panchayat area or other defined geographical area carved out in an ad-hoc manner. In this area a partnership-based action would be evolved.(i)The NGO builds awareness among teachers and parents - the former being motivated to function as envisaged in the Act and the latter insisting that the rights of their children are honoured by all concerned.(ii)Responsibility for infrastructure development and teacher provision remaining with relevant government agency/local authority, but NGOs taking responsibility for all other components, such as surveying the existing infrastructure, teacher performance, ensuring enrolment of all children; constitution, training and functioning of SMCs; prevention of harassment of teachers and enabling them to properly discharge their duties; insistence on gender sensitivity in all activities and transactions in schools; providing assistance in recognising infringement of RTE and to lodge grievances and pursue them till they are redressed.(iii)An NGO being provided necessary wherewithal to take responsibility for full implementation of RTE Act. In this case (as was done in the Lok Jumbish Project in Rajasthan) all resources required to meet the infrastructural needs, funds for appointment of teachers (to be done in the same manner as in government) and for conduct of good quality education are provided to the NGO on the basis of a proper project proposal. In this case a joint committee of representatives of the NGO, government, PRIs, teachers' unions, parents, etc. would guide and improvise the implementation.5.3.11Specialised support. - Some NGOs have expertise in specific areas, which should be drawn upon. Some of these are(i)children with special needs.(ii)involvement in design of infrastructure, including school buildings.(iii)publication of books and journals to enhance reading ability.(iv)gender training.5.3.12Monitoring and watchdog role:A crucial area for civil society intervention would be in playing a watchdog role to ensure that the rights of children are protected. The NCPCR and SCPCR have been entrusted with this role but given the scale of coverage, human resource availability, and enormity of the task, NCPCR/SCPCRs will be enabled to fulfill their role only with active involvement of civil society organisations, particularly those working at the grassroot level. In order to ensure that this task is undertaken effectively the j role of civil society needs to institutionally and systemically envisioned. 1 Some of the possibilities could include(i)providing accreditation to civil society organisations that would work as a part of the systematic mechanism for grievance | redressal.(ii)NCPCR and SCPCRs would be well advised to establish an effective network of civil society organisations and enable such organisations to undertake social audits, public hearings, etc.(iii)civil society should be included in any institutional mechanism being planned at the state as well as the district levels. The implementation of NREG Act provides a good precedent where state level commissioners have been appointed to monitor the implementation of that Act. In several instances, commissioners are active civil society members who have undertaken several initiatives to ensure that awareness is built around the Act and to articulate grievances.(iv)the Act envisages the establishment of National and State Advisory Committees where the active participation of civil society representatives can be brought in.5.3.13Social Audit. - Civil society organisations can facilitate a process of social audit with community involvement. Social audit would facilitate the checking, monitoring and verification of the SSA /RTE Act implementation at the village level. Transparency, participation and accountability will be maintained through the social audit in programme implementation. Social audit can be done at any point of time during the planning, preparation and implementation of SSA programme at village level. To conduct social audits, an enormous amount of community mobilisation is necessary. Social audit is carried out by the community and the entire Gram Sabha with the help of stakeholders like local authority members of SMC/VEC, PTA, Self Help Groups (SHGs), youth clubs, Mahila Samooh and representatives of disadvantaged groups, etc.5.4Role of Parents5.4.1Parents would need to play a more active role in school in monitoring the implementation of RTE stipulations and facilitating children to learn at their own pace without fear, anxiety and stress. Parents have a crucial role in understanding and appreciating the individual potential of every' child, and her/his own pace of learning. Parents need to be involved in discussion to understand the significance of interactive learning free from stress and anxiety, tests and exams being replaced by a system of continuous and comprehensive evaluation, the fact that there should be no corporal punishment, no tuition, and no detention. Once they are convinced of this, it would he easier to solicit their participation in the school development and management processes. Another challenging aspect before the community now is to identify out-of-school children in the locality and bring them to age appropriate class in a school. Efforts made in SSA for community participation will thus need to focus on awareness generation and participation of parents as an important partner.5.5Role of Children5.5.1Children's participation in universalising equitable access, retention and quality is an important and desirable catalyst for realization of their right to education. Without children's participation in the schooling process, schools cannot be made child-friendly and child- centered.Concepts like Children's Cabinet, Children's Parliament, Meena Manch, etc.need to be encouraged in every school, thus ensuring children's active participation in school management and development. SSA would encourage formation of children's collectives and support groups for children without adult protection to address deficit of community support and ownership.5.6Role of Teachers5.6.1Issues relating to teachers have been discussed in the Chapter 4 (Quality). However, in the context of community participation it is important to underline the significance of the teacher as a key partner in planning and implementing community participation strategies. In fact participation for RTE implies a mutually supportive and collaborative partnership among teachers, pupils, parents, community and civil society. It is an established fact that teachers perform better and with enthusiasm if they get wholehearted parental and community support. Therefore, the teacher like other stakeholders will have to be taken into confidence, and their capacities built to enable them play their part effectively.5.7Public Private Partnership and Corporate Social Responsibility5.7.1Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Organisations can play a crucial role by collaborating with community and local authorities for awareness generation and monitoring on RTE. They can bring in their ideas and resources in the areas of infrastructure development and capacity building etc.5.8SSA Support for Participation of Civil Society Organisations

1. | Community Mobilisation |  0.5% of the funds available under Managementcosts  
---|---|---  
2. | Scheme of Assistance for Voluntary Agencies |   
4. | Innovation funds | 50 lakhs per district  
5. |  Funds available within components like availablewithin components like IE, NPEGEL etc. for focused participationw.r.t. the concerned theme. |   
  
5.9Summing up5.9.1People's participation is fundamental to the success of SSA.
The objective of equitable quality for all children can be attained only with
active participation of all stakeholders including, parents, teachers,
community, civil society and children. SSA would strive to enhance
participation of general public by awareness generation, interventions for
community mobilization and by promoting voluntarism. While providing enough
support to NGOs, SSA would also help harness, full potential of grassroots
institution like, Mahila Samoohs, Sangathans, SHGs, Mahila Samakhya
federations, youth groups, groups working for people's rights, etc. as well as
support formation of children's collectives and support groups for children
without adult protection to address deficit of community support and ownership
in respect of these children.5.9.2Empowered and technically equipped SMCs
would be crucial for anchoring community awareness and participation efforts.
States will have to invest in capacity building of SMC members to address this
enormous challenge.5.9.3Participation of civil society is a crucial aspect of
SSA. SSA would encourage participation of voluntary agencies and NGOs in
different capacities ranging from advocates t o partners in need assessment
and implementation and watch dogs. The partnership would be mutual, and not in
the nature of subcontracting. During the next two years SSA can play a
critical role in catalysing the role of civil society involvement in
implementing RTE. As this will be a crucial period of re-orientation and
identification of new challenges and areas of work, flexibility and space
should be created within SSA to enable the development of innovations and in-
depth work in specific areas. SSA would strive for ensuring that civil society
organisations are included in every institutional mechanism being planned at
the state as well as the district levels.

### 6\. School Infrastructure Development

\- 6.1 Introduction6.1.1SSA aims to universalise access to elementary
education in accordance with the vision of the RTE Act. Quality of the school
building and availability of basic facilities therein is an important
determiner of school access. The built environment of the school has to be
inviting, attractive and comfortable to the child, so that the child is
motivated to enrol in and attend school regularly.6.1.2The school building has
to ensure easy access to all children and teachers and it has to be built with
a sensitive understanding of their different requirements. For instance,
special design features such as ramps, handrails, modified toilets etc are
required to be built for children with disabilities. Similarly, separate
toilets for girls including environmentally safe incinerators are definitely
required for the older girl students at the upper primary stage.
Considerations of equity in physical access must inform all interventions for
school infrastructure development as well. The classroom design with natural
light ventilation, seating, display, storage must ensure equity and quality in
educational transactions.6.1.3The built environment of the school, along with
the indoor and outdoor spaces, provides ample opportunities for learning.
Creative use of spaces inside the classroom, verandas, outdoor natural
environment and play areas- can serve to support learning. SSA has several
instances of tapping the pedagogic potential of school spaces. Such use of
school spaces will continue to be encouraged under SSA.6.1.4The Schedule to
the RTE Act lays down the norms and standards for a school building. A school
building has to be an all weather building comprising at least one classroom
for every teacher and an office-cum-store-cum- Head teachers room, barrier
free access, toilets, safe and adequate drinking water facility for all
children, arrangements for securing the school building boundary wall or green
fencing, a kitchen for cooking MDM, a playground, equipment for sports and
games, a library, and TLM.6.1.5SSA will support the creation of school
infrastructure as per the norms and standards specified in the RTE Act, both
through direct programme funding and also in convergence with other relevant
schemes of the Central and State Governments. Some examples of schemes with
which convergence is required for school infrastructure creation and lip
gradation are MDM scheme, drinking water, sanitation facilities, compound wall
and playground development by Ministry of Rural Development raising plantation
in school campus, under social forestry etc.6.2Whole School
Development6.2.1Development of school infrastructure is a comprehensive
exercise for developing the school building along with its indoor and outdoor
spaces in ways that contribute to the goals of universal access, retention,
equity and quality in education. Since the infrastructure design and
development contributes towards learning of children in the school, it is not
to be viewed narrowly as a building construction/ repair/maintenance activity
alone.6.2.2Schools' infrastructure will have to be well thought-out physical
learning environments and seen as integrated systems. They are no longer to be
visualised as mere physical structures of collections of rooms. The design
will need to address various aspects of the educational vision of the school.
Each school component and space will need to be seen from the lens of right of
the child and learning - existing as well as to be still made.6.2.3Whole
School Development Plan (WSDP) is a combination of educational plan that
guides the infrastructure plan and its effective usage in the learning
processes. Whole School Development Plan has to reflect the vision of a school
and ways to achieve it.6.2.4It is a master plan and base document for school's
educational as well as infrastructural work along with its development in
phases. Its planning is seen as an evolving process rather than one time
activity.6.3Unified Vision of a School6.3.1At the national level, the vision
is to develop each school's built-environment as an ecosystem for learning.
The school is envisioned as inclusive and pedagogically rich, sustainable eco-
system, safe and secure from hazards, incorporating elements of green
architecture, optimum resource-utilisation through culturally and
environmentally sustainable practices. Based on the above, the guiding
principles for Whole School Development Plan are:

### 1\. Infrastructure plan to follow the education plan

### 2\. Child-centred planning with overall development of child (physical,
social, emotional and cognitive) addressed

### 3\. Responsive towards needs of all children and the diversity they bring
in a school

### 4\. Entire school space (indoor and outdoor) as learning continuum for a
child and the teacher - this is to be recognised by all stakeholders while
planning

### 5\. Developing the entire school space as resource for fun and learning
activities using ideas of Building as Learning Aid (BaLA)

### 6\. A safe and secure environment for all children

### 7\. Clean and hygienic environment for all children

### 8\. Maximising the whole school as a resource - not just for children and
teachers of that school but also for the community and neighbour hood schools

### 9\. Respectful towards the local context and tradition - wisdom, social
needs, educational needs, culture, geology, climate, flora-fauna, etc.

### 10\. Optimum resource utilisation and cost-effectiveness

### 11\. Integrates good practices in environmentally sustainable designs - to
demonstrate and practice them

### 12\. Scope for future expansion

6.3.2Components of WSDP: The proposed components of WSDP a resummarized
below:6.3.3WSDP will strive to move in this direction and will also describe
SMC's plan to accomplish it in a phased manner. Being an evolving activity,
its outcome in a phase can be reviewed and mid-course corrections, if needed
be made.6.4Critical Considerations for Design, Planning and
Implementation6.4.1School infrastructure surveys. - SSA will support all
government and local body schools in meeting the infrastructure requirements
specified in the schedule to the RTE Act. Augmentation of existing school
infrastructure would require, inter alia, a survey of existing facilities in
every school. Such a survey measured school campus map can be undertaken with
community participation, facilitated by the School Management Committee etc.
Engineers/architects may also be included in these joint surveys. This is
necessary for a clear identification of school wise gaps in infrastructure
vis-a-vis RTE requirements.6.4.2Schools to have composite buildings. - Each
new school to be constructed under SSA will have a composite building,
containing all features specified in the schedule to the RTE Act. That is, it
shall have the requisite number of rooms, toilets and drinking water
facilities, MDM kitchen shed, fence/boundary wall, playground, sports
equipment, TLM and library. Existing government and local body schools will be
supported under SSA to .upgrade to the levels specified under the Act. Graded
augmentation of school infrastructure will be undertaken as enrollments
increase, in accordance with an infrastructure plan based on measured school
campus plan which will be a part of the School Development Plan to be prepared
by the School Management Committee (SMC). To determine the appropriateness of
physical spaces, following norms to be considered

Category | Gross area of classroom  
---|---  
Pre school | 2.00 sq. meter per child  
Primary School (with furniture) | 1.11 sq. meter per child  
Primary School (with squatting) | 0.74 sq. meter per child  
Sec. & High Secondary | 1.26 sq. meter per child  
  
6.4.3School buildings to adhere to specified construction standards. - The
National Building Code of India 2005, developed by the Bureau of Indian
Standards (BIS) provides guidelines for regulating building construction
activities across the country. It serves as a model code for adoption by all
agencies involved in building construction works, be they Public Works
Departments, other government construction departments, local bodies or
private construction agencies. The code should serve as a reference for all
States and UTs, for design and construction of school infrastructure. This
requirement does not preclude the use of local construction design, materials
and practices. These may be adapted suitably to incorporate especially the
requirements in the NBC regarding structural safety and also adhere to other
specifications regarding,' for instance, the minimum space required for each
child in the classroom. The relevant Indian Standard Codes (IS) are given
below:

S. No. | Codes | Functional Area  
---|---|---  
1. | IS 1893 (Part 1-2002) |  Criteria for earthquake resistant design ofstructure  
2. | IS 4326-1993 |  Practice for earthquake resistant design andconstruction of building.  
3. | IS 13828-1993 |  Guidelines for improving earthquake resistant oflow strength masonry building.  
4. | IS 13920-1993 |  Ductile detailing cf reinforced concretestructure subject to seismic force.  
5. | IS 456-2000 | Structural design of buildings.  
6. | IS 14435-19973 |  Code of practice of fire safety in educationalinstitutions.  
7. | IS 2440-1975 | Guide for day lighting of building.  
8. | IS 4963-1987 |  Recommendation for buildings and facilities forphysically handicapped.  
9. | IS 7662 (Part 1) - 1974 | Recommendation of orientation of building.  
10. | IS 4837-1990 |  School furniture, class room chair and tablesrecommendation.  
11. | IS 4838-1990 |  Anthropometries dimensions for school childrenage group 5-17 years.  
12. | IS 8827-1978 |  Recommendations for basic requirements of schoolbuildings  
13. | Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) 2007 | For energy conservation in buildings  
  
6.4.4School buildings to have barrier free access. - Barrier free access
implies that the physical design of the school building should be such that
all children, including children with disabilities, should be able to move in
all areas of the school and use all the facilities provided. Children with
disabilities should be able to enter the school building easily and negotiate
their way around the school and be able to use the playgrounds, drinking water
and toilet facilities, libraries and laboratories. States / UTs will need to
ensure that appropriate barrier free features, keeping in view the different
requirements of children with different disabilities, are incorporated in all
new building designs. Existing school buildings will need to be modified for
the purpose by creating ramps with hand rails, toilet modifications; non slip
walking surfaces, etc. All external and internal facilities and services in
the school will have to be reviewed to assess whether they allow access to
children with disabilities. Apart from barrier free access, features that
enable learning in different spaces for such children - special furniture,
display, learning boards and chalk boards that create inclusive situations for
all children to be also promoted.6.4.5School buildings to incorporate child
friendly features. - Schools are built for children. School building designs
should, therefore, respond to the needs of children. Different facilities in
the school should be built to the scale of the children, such as drinking
water taps and urinals at different heights for children of different age
groups/heights; children's chalkboards in classrooms at accessible height for
children; simple and usable display and storage spaces in the classrooms,
child friendly hardware fittings, spaces for children to interact and
communicate with peer group, elder or younger children or adults,
etc.6.4.6Maximising pedagogic potential of indoor and outdoor school spaces. -
Design of both indoor and outdoor spaces of the school can facilitate learning
in many different ways. The concept of 'BaLA' (Building as a Learning Aid) has
been implemented in several States to unlock the pedagogic potential of built
spaces and outdoor spaces in school premises. BaLA is about maximizing the
educational, learning and fun value of a built space for children. Buildings
are also the most expensive physical asset of a school. By innovatively
treating the existing or new school spaces (e.g. classroom, circulation
spaces, outdoors, natural environment) and their constituent built elements
(like the floor, wall, ceiling, door, windows, furniture, open ground), a
range of learning situations and materials can be integrated such that they
can actively be used as a learning resource. This resource could complement
teaching process and supplement textbook information, much beyond providing
wall space for posters and decoration. Attributes of the building like
dimensions, textures, shapes, angles, inside and outside, up and down and
movement in spaces can be used to communicate some basic concepts of language,
science, mathematics and environment, to make learning a truly enjoyable and
memorable experience for children. BaLA aims at using the built elements like
the floor, walls, pillars, staircases, windows, doors, ceilings, fans, trees,
flowers, or even rainwater falling on the building as learning resource. For
example, a window security grill can be designed to help the children practice
pre-writing skills or understand functions; a range of angles can be marked
under a door shutter on the floor to explain the concept of angles; or ceiling
fans can be painted with colour wheels for the children to enjoy ever-changing
formations; moving shadows of a flag-pole to act like a sundial to understand
different ways of measuring time; planting trees that shed their leaves in
winters and are green in summers to make a comfortable outdoor learning space.
This is graded for different age groups and classes and can be adapted towards
school-specific needs. With proper implementation, it not only helps in making
the school inviting and attractive for children, it also helps in retaining
them to be constructively engaged during and beyond school hours.6.4.7School
buildings to incorporate safety features for resistance against hazards. - SSA
will ensure that children receive education in a safe and secure environment.
All school buildings under SSA will provide safety features in the structural
design of the school buildings in order to make the school buildings safe.
Structural safety features (against natural hazards such as earthquakes)
should be built into the designs of new school buildings and existing school
buildings should be retrofitted. The various IS codes for earthquake resistant
design and construction and the safety features incorporated in the National
Building Code, 2005 should inform the construction of school buildings that
are safe for children. There are other natural and man made hazards against
which appropriate safety should be ensured, such as floods, cyclones, fires,
etc.6.4.8Creating a shelf of class room or learning space and school building
designs. - The diversity of terrain and climates in different parts of the
country and even within States requires the development of different
classroom/learning space as well as school building designs that can respond
to its particular features. In light of RTE, with increase in diversity of
children within the classrooms, it is important that classroom and learning
space design addresses their learning issues, functionality and comfort in the
physical setting also. For example, schools where Activity Based Learning
(ABL) i s practiced could have different types of classrooms and furniture
design. Similarly those in desert areas would require designs, layout,
alignment and construction materials that do not trap heat in the building.
Region specific as well as site specific design strategies for schools may be
developed, depending on the climate, locally available construction materials
and skills. School building designs may use local and traditional
architectural solutions with appropriate adaptations to ensure safety. SSA
does not prescribe any generic school building design or unit costs for
construction of classrooms. These will be as per State norms and as per State
schedule of rates. Large number of (more than 100) building designs for school
shave been developed in DPEP districts. These designs, apart from being
attractive, are child centred, functional and in tune with the new pedagogical
concepts. The publication called "Building rural Primary schools" published by
the Ed.CIL and the building construction manuals developed by the Lok Jumbish
Project may be utilised by all the States / districts to develop their civil
works plan. The States may make use of designs already developed under DPEP/
Lok Jumbish Project in their specific local contexts. Incorporation of child-
friendly internal and external elements will be mandatory in all the new
construction and repair works.6.5Other Provisions for School Infrastructure
Development6.5.1Major repairs. - There are large numbers of schools that
cannot be repaired under the available maintenance grant. To facilitate the
availability of funds for major repairs, civil works component of SSA allows
major repairs up to Rs. 150 crore nationally, per annum under SSA subject to
the conditions laid down in the relevant norms.6.5.2Adaptation of existing
built environment (indoors / outdoors) towards new pedagogy Due to various
innovations in pedagogy, either due to NCF-2005 or Activity Based Learning or
LEP, there may be requirement for adaptation of existing learning spaces -
classrooms, head teacher room, corridors, libraries, play spaces, outdoor
spaces, terraces, amenities, etc. towards quality in learning. In light of the
above, it is important to systematically identify the nature of adaptations
and find the most cost-effective method to achieve it.6.5.3Retrofitting the
existing buildings towards hazard resistance, thermal comfort, better light
and ventilation. - Schools have been built prior to SSA and also during SSA.
Depending on geographical location, its susceptibility to natural or man made
hazards, may need to be clearly understood and suitable remedial measures in
the form retrofitting be taken up. Similarly, many such schools may need
modification in its openings or roofing, flooring, etc. to ensure better
functionality of existing spaces from the perspective of adequate natural
light, ventilation, thermal comfort, etc. Any such intervention will be less
resource intensive than making afresh. However, here again the most effective
methods may be used for such adaptations.6.5.4Drinking water and sanitation
facilities. - Department of Drinking Water Supply in the Ministry of Rural
Development, Government of India has a provision under the National Rural
Drinking Water Mission to provide drinking water facility in rural schools.
Further, Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) of the Department of Drinking Water
Supply supports the creation of sanitation facilities (toilet and urinals) in
rural schools. Rural schools that were sanctioned outside SSA and which do not
have drinking water and sanitation facilities, can be covered under these
schemes. However, provision of all sanitation facilities must be linked to the
strength of boys, girls and adult users of the school, as per norms
prescribed. It must be noted that in day-schools, the number of urinals for
girls and boys may be more as compared to toilets and must be inclusive and
barrier free and usable by adult school staff as well. When
adding/constructing new, it will important to review the functionality of
existing facilities and its effective usage also. Cost towards ensuring
functionality and safety of existing urinals, toilets, drinking water by way
of repair / augmentation / retrofitting shall be supported by SSA. The
agencies responsible for implementing SSA and drinking water and sanitation
programmes may coordinate their efforts to ensure coverage of all
schools.6.5.5Playgrounds and Outdoor spaces. - Outdoor space is important for
overall child development, provided it is sensitively developed. This may
contain school garden (e.g. kitchen garden / herbal garden), tree groves,
places of mutual interactions, sports and play spaces, etc. The school
playground shall be maintained through community mobilization, community
shramdan or community contribution or through convergence as is being done
already.6.5.6Kitchen sheds. - A kitchen with specifications that keep the
kitchen clean and hygienic can be provided in all new schools under SSA. In
all schools sanctioned outside the scheme of SSA, provision for kitchen sheds
is made under the MDM scheme.6.5.7Boundary wall or fencing. - All school
campuses shall be secured by providing boundary wall or green fencing with a
gate. This will help to secure the school premises and also enable development
of a school garden. This will make the campus green, child friendly and safe
for the children.6.5.8Furniture for upper primary schools. - Wherever the
States/UTs' have achieved substantial progress in filling up infrastructure
gaps and the civil works, requirement is less than 33% of the total district
outlay, furniture to Government Upper Primary Schools @ Rs. 500 per child as a
one time grant can be given, provided the civil work ceiling inclusive of
furniture for children, is not more than 33% of the district outlay. It is
also mandatory that funds are not pooled and procurement will be done by the
School Management Committee. It is suggested that, based on the evolving
pedagogy, as emerging from the quality perspective, age and pedagogy
appropriate model designs of furniture be developed and shared with SMCs so
that, when they get it made, it is suitable to the educational activities in
the classroom.6.5.9Residential hostels. - There are certain areas in the
country where it is unviable to set up schools. These include sparsely
populated or hilly and densely forested areas with difficult geographical
terrains. There are also densely populated urban areas, where it is difficult
to get land for establishing schools. Also, in urban areas, there are a number
of urban deprived children: homeless and street children in difficult
circumstances, without adult protection, who require not merely day schooling
facilities, but also lodging and boarding facilities. Residential hostels can
be built for children under SSA as per norms in this regard.6.5.10Construction
of KGBV buildings. - KGBVs provide residential schools in educationally
backward blocks at upper primary level for girls belonging predominantly to
the SC, ST, OBC and minority communities. There are three models of KGBV
schools. The States will develop their own innovative designs for KGBV
buildings. The construction of KGBV can be done by the State SSA Mission
Society or any other technical agency, as appropriate.6.6Planning and
Implementation6.6.1Community's active role in school infrastructure
development. - Planning and implementation by the community through SMC in all
school infrastructure development activities will be mandatory in order to
ensure a sense of ownership and a departure from contractor driven approaches.
Engagement of contractors in building construction will not be allowed under
SSA. Community participation envisaged under Lok Jumbish, DPEP and under SSA
in many States has been very encouraging and these will be
continued.6.6.2Transparency and social accountability. - There will be
complete transparency in all works undertaken under SSA, especially those for
school infrastructure development. The technical design, financial approvals,
received and spent amounts, muster rolls, measurement books, books of accounts
etc. in respect of the works shall be available for perusal/copies in
accordance with the provisions of the Right to Information Act. In fact,
proactive disclosure of this information in the meetings of the SMC and the
entire Gram Sabha will be encouraged under SSA. Besides regular financial
audit as per extant rules, social audit will be encouraged to strengthen
social accountability to the community which has a real and direct stake in a
well functioning school.6.7Capacity Building of SMC for Undertaking Building
Construction. - 6.7.1 Construction activities under SSA are to be undertaken
with community involvement. No contractors can be engaged for the task, except
in the rare cases of such buildings that, in the opinion of the PAB, require
special design and technical skills. SSA will encourage use of local
construction materials and low cost and environment friendly technologies,
without compromising on the structural soundness and safety of the building.
The SMC will need to be trained in certain specific technical aspects such as
collaborating in the development of drawings, understanding cost estimates,
assessing building material quality, keeping accounts, material procurement
etc. Training will also include aspects like payment of at least minimum
wages; equal wages to women, no engagement of child labour, maintaining
transparency about funds received and used through social audits, display
boards etc. The training can be imparted in a simple and effective manner in
the local language, through technical/other experts, who are themselves
trained to communicate effectively and demystify these issues.6.8Allocation
for School Infrastructure Development. - 6.8.1 The allocation for School
Infrastructure Development (formerly Civil Works) will not exceed 33% of the
total approved outlays under SSA on the entire project cost. However, in the
finalisation of a particular year's plan, provision of civil works can be made
at a higher level depending on the priority assigned to various components of
the programme. In a particular year's annual plan, provision for civil works
can be considered up to 50% of the annual plan expenditure, within the overall
project ceiling of 33%.6.9Unit Cost. - 6.9.1 The unit cost, where not
specifically mentioned in the SSA norms, would be based on State Schedule of
Rates (SoR) duly notified by State Government. In case of drinking water
facility and toilet facility, also the unit cost should be worked out on the
basis of Schedule of Rates for these works duly notified by the State
Government.6.10Technical Support for Implementation. - 6.10.1
Creating/accessing technical capacity for large scale school infrastructure
creation and for quality assurance. - For meeting the infrastructure
requirements of new and existing schools within the defined timelines,
sufficient numbers of technically qualified staff will need to be put in place
at block, district and State level for assisting the SMC with technical
drawings and estimates and for quality supervision. States will need to evolve
systems for communicating the specific requirements of school . buildings
(child friendly design of classrooms and facilities, outdoor and indoor spaces
to be developed as learning resources, safety and hazard resistant features,
barrier free access, whole school planning etc) to the technical personnel,
especially if they are from State Works Departments, since these Works
Departments may have not been oriented on these themes from a child centred or
pedagogic-perspective. The local level construction agency will also need to
be oriented on these perspectives.6.10.2Quality Assurance. - In order to
assure quality of civil works, an independent assessment of the technical
quality of civil works, through Third Party Evaluation (TPE)Ts mandatory. The
commissioning of TPE to assure quality of construction visit of TPE at plinth,
lintel, roof and at finishing level is essential. It should also ensure that
construction has been carried out in accordance with design, drawings and
specification. Besides checking the quality of building material by visual
inspection, testing of building material and building technology, design
functionality and role of community participation are ensured. The TPE is to
highlight good practices, bring out strength and weaknesses and share with the
block/district/state level engineers and Administrators in weekly and monthly
meetings for further improvement. In addition inbuilt quality control test for
building material and building technologies are under taken by in house
engineering cell or agency supervising / facilitating technical support (these
tests are essential particularly for major building like KGBVs and Residential
schools).6.10.3Setting up design cell at State and district level. - A design
cell in the civil works unit at the State and district level is essential for
Whole school development plan. The unit must have Design engineers,
Architects, Structural engineers well conversant with earth quake resistant
designs and experts in Energy efficiency/Green buildings issues, Experts from
Pedagogy, Gender and Inclusive Education etc. who are well oriented on the
philosophy of SSA. The Design cell experts can either be on deputation/on
contract or on empanelment.6.11SSA Support for School Infrastructure

### 7\. Management And Monitoring.

\- 7.1 Management7.1.1In every state of our country, there are age-old systems
for administration of elementary education. Over the years, SSA has
superimposed on these systems. A management structure which has more or less
satisfactorily met the needs of the project. In most States, the extant
administrative system and the one created for implementation of SSA have
endured side by side. The RTE Act has created a circumstance in which the
existing two- dimensional system must be reviewed and, while causing no
detriment to the ongoing SSA project, within the shortest possible time, a
system should be created which would adequately respond to the demands of the
new law. Staffing and strengthening of Management Structures at the national,
state, district, block and cluster levels would be a prerequisite in timely
and efficient implementation of the programme. The project management
structure and requirement of manpower, delegation and capacity building would
have to be reviewed in light of the larger fund availability and considerable
expansion of the activities of SSA in view of the RTE Act.7.2Harmonisation of
the Departmental and SSA Structures at the National Level. - 7.2.1 The SSA is
governed at the Centre by a General Body chaired by the Prime Minister, an
Executive Committee and a Project Approval Board. In the states, it is
implemented through separately registered societies with staff deputed from
the State Government or appointed on contract. A Governing Body and an
Executive Committee functions in every State too. A State Project Director
oversees the SSA at the State level, in addition to the already existing
Director/Commissioner of Education.7.2.2The RTE Act envisages a National
Advisory Council at the Centre1 and State Advisory Councils, to advice on the
implementation of the Act. As for monitoring, the Act designates the NCPCR and
the SCPCRs (or REP A) to ensure that the rights of children are not violated.

### 1\. Notification constituting the National Advisory Council (NAC) is at
Annexure 25

7.2.3SSA has a Joint Review Mission (JRM) that reviews the progress of the
project every six months. The developmental partners of SSA, namely the World
Bank, the DFID and the European Commission, are a part of this JRM
exercise.7.2.4RTE requires the entire education department to be geared in a
unified manner to take up the task on a long term basis. In the long run, this
would require the unification of the existing SSA structures with the regular
education department! The actual convergence of SSA structures with the
regular education department and the SCERT should commence immediately;
dichotomous and overlapping structures, wherever they exist and are adversely
affecting the programme, should be eliminated. However, complete integration
of SSA and Elementary Education Department structures may take some time. It
is, therefore, prudent to implement a transitional strategy whereby a modified
SSA remains the modality to be replaced by a new scheme compatible with the
provisions of the Act from the middle of the Twelfth Plan period. Till then,
SSA would be the vehicle for implementation of the RTE Act.7.2.5Thus, the
NAC/SACs under the RTE Act will coexist with the General Body and Executive
Committee structure of the SSA till the NAC/SACs take over the full advisory
role by end of the Eleventh Plan. Similarly, as the NCPCR/SCPCR (REPA)
gradually takes over the monitoring role, and it becomes clear what the future
role of the development partners shall be beyond the Eleventh Plan period, the
JRM would continue. In the meantime, the precise nature of review and
monitoring beyond the Eleventh Plan could be worked out in a manner that
fulfils the provisions of the Act.7.3The State Level Structure. - 7.3.1 The
RTE Act has tasks that are not necessarily confined to the MHRD or the State
Education Departments. Direct responsibility to provide schools,
infrastructure, trained teachers, curriculum and teaching learning material,
and mid day meal undoubtedly lies with the Education Departments of the State
Governments, including SCERTs and SSA. But the factors that contribute to the
achievement of the overall goal of universalising elementary education, as a
fundamental right, require action on the part of the whole Government. A well
coordinated mechanism is needed for inter-sectoral collaboration and
convergence.• The Finance Departments must provide adequate and appropriate
financial allocations and timely releases of funds at all levels.• The Public
Works Departments need to re-conceptualise and re-design school spaces from
the pedagogic perspective, and address issues of inclusion for children with
disabilities through barrier free access.• The Departments of Science and
Technology should provide geo-spatial technologies for school mapping and
location to supplement social mapping exercises at the grassroots level.•
Programmes for Water and Sanitation must ensure access to adequate and safe
drinking water, and accessible and adequate sanitation facilities especially
for girls in schools.• The RTE Act mandates that every child must be in
school; this pre-supposes that child labour will be eliminated. The Labour
Departments must align their policies with the RTE Act, so that all children
can participate in the schooling process regularly.• The immense relevance of
inclusive education, particularly of disadvantaged groups, demands vibrant
partnerships with the departments and organisations concerned with children of
SC, ST, and educationally backward minorities.• Systems for equal opportunity
for children with special needs will need to be addressed with the departments
handling children with disabilities.• The Rural Development and Panchayat Raj
Departments would need to accelerate poverty reduction programmes, so that
children are freed from domestic chores and wage earning responsibilities.•
State Governments must simultaneously ensure that the panchayat raj
institutions get appropriately involved so that the "local authorities" can
discharge their functions under the RTE Act.• There is need for close
cooperation with the NCPCR/SCPCR and the Departments of Women and Child
Development to ensure that children get their rights under the RTE Act.•
Programmes under the National Rural Health Mission must take up school health
programmes, including de-worming and micro-nutrient supplementation, with
special attention to vulnerable groups, especially girls approaching
adolescence.• The Sports Departments would need to build in physical education
and yoga for the overall physical, social, emotional and mental development of
the child.7.3.2It is also necessary to initiate measures for integration of
the two systems - the SSA project management and the directorate of elementary
education. The characteristics of the new integrated management system at the
State level would include:(i)continuance of practically all the components of
the office of SPD;(ii)Its being able to serve as the secretariat to the
society which, inter alia, would continue to channelise funds from the central
and State Governments (including the transfers made on the recommendation of
the Finance Commission);(iii)Having the ability to discharge responsibilities
envisaged under the RTE Act;(iv)Dispensing with problems created by
multiplicity of departments/sub- departments (such as SPD, Director of Primary
Education, Director of SCERT, etc) and lack of unified leadership;
and(v)Having an inbuilt ability to coordinate and provide the required
proficiency.State Level Integrated Structure For SSA And RTE7.4District Level
Structure. - 7.4.1 In the new system, it is only logical that the District
Education Officers (DEOs) should fully combine the functions of DEO as well as
District Project Coordinators (DPCs). There would then be no need for the
position of Additional DPC. DEO would have, more or less, all the units that
are envisaged at the State level. He/she would liaise with DIET and in
cooperation with that Institute oversee the functioning of BRCs and CRCs. Each
of the 6-8 unit heads in the set up of DEO would function in matrix mode,
which implies that each unit head would have responsibility for one or more
subject areas as well as over one or more blocks (BEO as well as
BRC/CRC).District Level Integrated Structure7.5Local Authority. - 7.5.1
Responsibility for implementation of the RTE Act has been vested in
"appropriate government" (mainly State Governments and UT Administrations) and
the local authority. These functions are spelt out in Sections 8 and 9. In
addition, the local authority is to consider and redress the grievances
relating to the right of the child as stated in Section 32. Local authority is
defined under Section 2(h) as follows:"local authority" means a Municipal
Corporation or Municipal Council or Zila Parishad or Nagar Panchayat or
Panchayat, by whatever name called, and includes such other authority or body
having administrative control over the school or empowered by or under any law
for the time being in force to function as a local authority in any city, town
or village;.7.5.2This definition indicates that municipal bodies and
panchayats are local authority; and in addition (a) a body having
administrative control over schools of the area; and (b) a body set up under
state/UT law or by an order issued by it would also be included as "local
authority". This implies that in all areas, at the minimum, the elected local
body as well as the local administrative apparatus shall comprise the local
authority. The only scope for State/UT specific variation may consist of any
committee or council or some such body set up by a State Government/UT
Administration-which too would come within the definition of local authority.
The State Governments/UT Administrations have, generally speaking, elucidated
the inter se relationship among these bodies. However, where this has not been
clarified the State Governments/UT Administrations could do so now.7.6School
Management Committee (SMC). - 7.6.1 While system level management structures
get reformed on the lines indicated above, for effective implementations of
various provisions, ensuring that children's right to education along with
various entitlements specified in the RTE Act rests with the School Management
Committee and the school heads. The RTE Act gives immense importance to SMCs
as the decentralised structure, and one in which the parents will have a very
significant role. Essential provisions regarding constitution and functions of
SMCs have been given in Sections 21 and 22. These have been elaborated in the
draft Rules prepared for consideration and adoption by State Governments/UT
Administrations with such modifications as they may consider appropriate. In
addition to those provisions there is need to lay emphasis on the following
issues:7.6.2The State Governments have to issue further guideline to ensure
that SMCs are enabled to function in an effective manner and arrangements are
made for adequate capacity building. Relating school grants to School
Development Plans under RTE adds a new dimension to utilisation of school
grants. This envisages that current practice of providing predetermined
schematic budgets is replaced by and providing support based on plans
developed by School Development Committees.Wherever the State Governments and
UTs designate the Panchayat Raj Institution (PRI) as the local authority,
their support may be taken to fulfill the following responsibilities in
elementary education:

### 1\. Creating an enabling environment for realising the rights of children
under the RTE Act. Ideally, a mass mobilisation campaign should be launched to
create a groundswell for children's rights under the RTE Act, on the lines of
the literacy campaigns launched in the 1990s. SSA norms have been revised to
provide 0.5% of the annual outlay for community mobilisation activities, and
these funds could be utilised for launching a well conceptualised RTE
campaign.

### 2\. Initiate the development of action plans for opening new schools in
unserved areas, through a mapping of existing institutions, locating
appropriate sites for new schools, and delineating the catchment area of each
school according to local logistics, and subject to norms and standards laid
down under the RTE Act and Rules.

### 3\. Identify out-of-school children, largely representing weaker sections
and disadvantaged groups, ensuring age appropriate admission through Special
Training, motivating parents and creating conditions to free them from
domestic/ wage earning responsibilities, and monitoring regular attendance of
all children and teachers in schools. Similarly, PRIs could be involved in
special intensive efforts required for migrant children, and ensuring that
they are provided educational opportunities through establishment of seasonal
hostels.

### 4\. For differently-abled children, PRIs could render valuable support in
identification, determination of the level of their disability through
organised camps, ensuring that appropriate aids and appliances are made
available to such children, and ensuring that such children are provided
adequate support for being mainstreamed in regular schools.

### 5\. Initiate a campaign to register the birth of all children up to the
age of 18 years in order to maintain records of children. As part of this
exercise, a computerised data base of every child below the age of 18 years
may be prepared and their progress tracked. Such a data base could provide the
basis for preparing school development plans by School Management Committees,
which can be aggregated at the district level.

### 6\. Monitor teacher vacancies in schools and send reports to the
educational authority concerned. They may also monitor teacher training, and
provide infrastructure facilities wherever required. Attendance monitoring
could be the responsibility of Gram Panchayat.

### 7\. Develop and improve infrastructure, by using their own funds or funds
devolved by the State Finance Commissions and the 13th Finance Commission, or
funds from schemes like BRGF.

### 8\. Set up Grievance Redressal Committees headed by the Chairperson of the
PRI body or the Chairperson of the Standing Committee concerned. The Grievance
Redressal Committee may set up a small enquiry group consisting of three or
four persons representing the PRI, the Education Department and the Civil
Society. This group may enquire into petitions and complaints and submit
reports to the Grievance Redressal Committee. Thereafter, the Grievance
Redressal Committee could hear the persons concerned, take decisions and issue
necessary directions for settling the grievance. Detailed procedural
guidelines need be issued to ensure that due process is followed and orders
are issued.

### 9\. Set up an Education Committee in order to oversee the
operationalization of the RTE Act. This could be an enlarged version of the
Standing Committee dealing with education in a Local Government and may
consist of elected representatives, experts, activists, parents, headmasters
and officials from the Education Department.

7.7Monitoring. - 7.7.1 Following is abroad grouping of monitoring mechanisms
and processes anchored at community/village, school, block, district, state
and national levels.7.7.2Monitoring by the SMC. - The support of the SMC and
village based organisations would be invaluable in communicating in simple and
creative ways the rights of the child as enunciated in the Act to the
population in the neighbourhood of the school; as also the duties of the
appropriate Government, local authority, school, parents and guardians. In
pursuance of the RTE Act, SSA will institute a community based monitoring
system for the SMC to(i)ensure the enrolment and attendance of all the
children, especially children belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker
sections in the school(s);(ii)ensure that children belonging to disadvantaged
groups and weaker sections are not discriminated against, and prevented from
pursuing and completing elementary education.(iii)monitor that all not-
enrolled and drop out children are facilitated to participate in Special
Training for age appropriate admission to regular school as per section 4 of
the RTE Act.(iv)monitor the identification, enrolment and participation of
children with disability in elementary education, and ensure that facilities
for their education are provided.(v)ensure that child rights under the RTE
Act, especially rights with respect to prohibition of physical and mental
harassment, expulsion and detention, the provision of any-time admission are
observed in letter and spirit, and that child entitlements, including
uniforms, text books, mid-day meal, etc. are provided in a timely manner.
Deviations would be taken up with the Head Teacher. The SMC would bring
instances of persistent disregard of child rights to the notice of the local
authority.(vi)monitor the maintenance of the norms and standards specified in
the Schedule to the RTE Act.(vii)monitor that teachers are not burdened with
non-academic duties other than those specified in section 27 of the RTE, viz.,
decennial population census, disaster relief and elections to Parliament,
Legislature and Local Bodies;(viii)ensure that teachers maintain regularity
and punctuality in attendance as per Section 24(a), hold regular meetings with
parents to apprise them about their child's progress as per section 24(e), and
do not engage in private tuition as per section 28 of the RTE Act.7.8School
Supervision by Block and Cluster Functionaries. - 7.8.1 During the last few
decades school supervision has grievously suffered due to insufficiency of
staff and administrative neglect. The effort made under SSA, through
establishment of BRCs and CRCs, has improved matters marginally, but the
overall situation has remained essentially unchanged. As a result, functioning
of schools has deteriorated and quality of the teaching-learning process has
shown no improvement. Improvement of quality of education is a pre-requisite
of successful implementation of the RTE Act.7.8.2Periodic inspection/super
vision of schools to observe the infrastructure and facilities and the
administrative aspects is critical. In addition, a proper system of academic
and curricular support has to be developed to serve the purpose of continuing
professional upgradation of teachers and to see that school syllabi and
learner evaluation system are operationalised as expected.7.8.3Each Block
Education Officer should have a contingent of Assistant EOs (with whatever
designation), who should be expected to undertake at least two visits to every
school each year. Among other things they should look at the record required
to be maintained by teachers/headmasters, condition of school building and
infrastructure and seating arrangement for students. They should be asked to
pay particular attention to availability of potable drinking water, usability
of toilets, kitchen where MDM is cooked and whether the school has well-
maintained boundary wall.7.8.4Each BRC has specialist staff of 5-7. Besides,
there are a number of CRCs, perhaps one for every 15 villages. Between the
staff of these two resource centres, it should be possible for one person to
visit each school once every two months, every month, if the circumstances so
allow. The purpose of these visits would be to provide curricular support to
teachers - particularly progress with syllabus, the manner in which use is
being made of textbooks and other materials, assess and support teachers
develop TLM and the manner in which continuous and comprehensive evaluation is
being put into effect. In addition, BRCs ought to conduct workshops with
subject teachers of upper primary classes and they as well as CRCs should
organise trainings expected of them.7.8.5The staff from the office of BEO as
well as from BRCs and CRCs should ordinarily not to be expected to prepare
inspection/visit reports. Rather, they should record their main observations
in a register that may be maintained in each school. ITMs/teachers should take
action on the visit note. In addition, computer should be available in the
office of BEO, and in BRCs and CRCs so that important observations
(particularly points on which administrative action is to be taken) are shared
through internet.7.9Monitoring of the District Level. - 7.9.1 At the district
level, SSA will have the following mechanism for monitoring the
programme:(i)Independent and regular field visits to monitor performance by
Social Science Monitoring Institutes.(ii)Regular visit to field by Resource
Persons and TSG Consultants(iii)Visits by District Level Committee comprising
local/public representatives to monitor the implementation of the SSA
programme in the districts(iv)District Information System for Education
(DISE)7.10Monitoring through DISE. - 7.10.1 The school-based annual
information system, called District Information System for Education (DISE),
will continue to be implemented throughout the country. Through this system,
data on important aspects of a school, such as physical infrastructure and
facilities, availability of teachers, enrolment by social category, age of a
child, medium of instruction and training of teachers, etc. is collected
annually with 30th September as the reference date.7.10.2Certain new variables
have been added in the DISE Data Capture Formats (DCF) to ensure monitoring of
all aspects of the RTE Act in the school. The new items include, (i)
information on the constitution and functionality of SMCs, (ii) number of
instructional days, (iii) special training in the context of age appropriate
admission, (iii) TLM, (iv) transport facility, (v) average attendance etc.
Collection of data on new items will commence from 2010-11.7.10.3DISE data
covers all schools irrespective of its type i.e. recognized or un-recognized,
and its management, whether government or private. The data collected under
DISE should be used for all purposes and treated as official data for the
State. The States should move towards a unified system of collecting data for
elementary level. The ongoing parallel systems in several states should be
unified and integrated in DISE.7.10.4DISE based information and analysis
throws light on infrastructure facilities, access, retention, teacher-related
issues and are immensely useful for monitoring, planning and mid-course
corrections. Teachers 'rationalisation, prioritisation of physical
infrastructure and teachers' training issues can be addressed through
effective use of DISE data.7.10.5DISE data must undergo consistency checks and
requisite post enumeration survey. In order to increase transparency, the
information provided by the schools to DISE should be publicly displayed in
each school. The DISE software has the facility to print School Report Cards
which can be displayed on notice board of each school. Moreover, the schools'
report cards can also be printed from the web-site (www.schoolreportcards.in).
Besides this, a system of reading DISE data to the community through a Shiksha
Gram Sabha or Jan-Vaachan should be carried out in respect of each school by
the SMC.7.10.6NUEPA has been bringing out a series of publications every year
entitled 'Flash Statistics', 'Analytical Reports', 'State Report Cards',
'District Report Cards', 'Elementary Education in India: Rural/Urban' and
'Analytical Tables' based on the data received from the States. These reports
should be taken into account for monitoring the outcomes.7.11Monitoring at the
State Level. - 7.11.1 The following monitoring mechanism is provided at the
state level:(i)State Commission for Protection of Child Rights or Right to
Education Protection Authority(ii)Periodic meetings of the State Executive
Committee of SSA(iii)State level quarterly review meetings with State
Coordinators of important functional areas including financial
management.(iv)Internal audit by the States.(v)State specific responsibilities
to Research and Resource Institutions for supervision, monitoring, evaluation
and research activities.7.11.2The State SSA Societies will also undertake
intensive monitoring. Representatives of the National Mission for UEE and
National level institutions like NCTE, NUEPA, NCERT and TSG will also
undertake periodic monitoring and provide resource support to the SIS to
strengthen planning, management and monitoring systems. Efforts to associate
autonomous institutions willing to take up State specific responsibilities for
research and evaluation would continue. Independent institutions would also be
associated in developing effective tools for conducting achievement tests,
monitoring quality aspects of programme implementation, undertaking
evaluations and research studies.7.12Monitoring at the National Level. -
7.12.1 Monitoring at the national level would include the following aspects of
the RTE Act:• Availability of schooling facility both at primary level and
upper primary level in all the habitations to ensure physical and social
access in the neighbourhood.• Addressing needs of children living in very
small hamlets (in remote, desert/ tribal areas) where opening of schools is
not visible and ensuring access by providing free transportation to and fro
school and or through residential facility to ensure access J for such
children.• Integration of Class VIII with upper primary schools and Class V
with primary schools, in those States which follow a four year primary
education cycle and seven upper primary cycle.• The school development plans
which have to be prepared by SMCs to ensure that schools have all facilities
such as infrastructure, teachers, TLE and child friendly and barrier free
access with good learning environment.• Issues of gender and social exclusion
under the ambit of SSA, NPEGEL and KG13V, gender based discrimination should
become an integral part of social audit.• Ensuring age-appropriate admission
in neighbourhood schools for children especially those belonging to the
disadvantage groups such as children of Dalit and Tribal communities, Muslim
and other minority children, girls, urban deprived children, street
children/child labour and children without adult protection etc.• The process
of providing special training to the children, who are admitted in schools to
bring them at par with other children.• Formulation of child rights based
policies and enabling provisions for implementing the RTE Act, 2009 e.g.
banning screening for admission, no board exams, no detention, banning
corporal punishment, etc.7.12.2In addition, SSA would continue to conduct the
following:(i)National level half yearly review meetings and quarterly regional
review meetings with State Education Secretaries and State Project
Directors.(ii)National, Regional and State specific review meetings capacity
building training programmes.(iii)Half yearly Joint Review Missions by
Government of India, the State Governments and (any) external funding
agencies.(iv)Independent assessment/studies to be carried out for independent
feedback on implementation of the programme.(v)A Computerised Educational
Management Information System giving annual school based data with school and
district report cards by NUEPA.(vi)An Educational Development Index (EDI) to
assess State's/District 's progress towards Universalisation of Elementary
Education (UEE) by NUEPA.(vii)A set of Quality Monitoring Tools developed in
collaboration with NCERT to provide quarterly and annual information on
quality related indices.(viii)Results framework to measure outcomes against
the pre decided targets and baseline.(ix)Statutory audit of SSA accounts
annually by Chartered Accountant Firms (from CAG approved panel)(x)Concurrent
Financial Review of SSA accounts by Institute of Public Auditors of India
(IPAI).(xi)Periodical review of physical and financial progress of the
programme by TSG Consultants.(xii)Base line assessment of learning
achievements at the primary level and the upper primary level in all States by
NCERT.(xiii)Field visits by Members of the EE Bureau and TSG.(xiv)Field based
monitoring by Monitoring Institutes (MIs).7.12.3Monitoring Institutes. -
Institutions, including University Departments of Education, Social Science
and Institutes of national stature have been assigned the work of periodic
monitoring of SSA implementation in States & UTs. In large States, more than
one Institute has been assigned the task of monitoring. These Monitoring
Institutes (MIs) are required to make field visit and report on progress of
SSA at the ground level every six months. This cycle is repeated every two
years. The half yearly monitoring reports received from the Monitoring
Institutes are available on the website- www.ssa.nic.in SSA programme modifies
the terms of reference of the Monitoring Institutes as and when
required.7.12.4Web portal. - The web portal for SSA (www.ssa.nic.in) has been
operationalised with the help of National Information Centre (NIC) to
facilitate monitoring and programme management. The portal has two interfaces;
a) Government to Citizens (G to C), and, b) Government to Government (G to
G).(a)The G to C interface has been developed to enable citizens of the
country monitor the progress made indifferent components of SSA. Important
information like minutes of the Project Approval Board (PAB) meetings and
sanctions to states have been uploaded on this interface.(b)The G to G
interface has a management information system (MIS) which keeps track of all
the interventions of the programme. The progress made by each State is
monitored on quarterly basis.7.12.5Results Framework. - A Results Framework
with identified measurable indicators, baseline and targeted results and
frequency of measuring outcomes has been developed and has been in use for
some time. The States/ districts are expected to develop the State/ district
specific Results Framework on the suggested indicators.7.12.6Surveys and
research studies. - In order to assess SSA impact across the states on
education indicators like enrolment, student/ teacher attendance and retention
etc. the National Mission of SSA commissions surveys and research studies. The
findings of these surveys and studies help in ascertaining the degree of SSA's
success on key indicators and assessment of needs and gaps for course
correction and follow-up.7.12.7Technical Support Group (TSG). - The TSG in
Ed.CIL has been created to provide technical support in functional areas
pertaining to access, equity and quality of education. Different Units in TSG
also monitor very closely, planning and management, financial aspects,
processes for improving access, equity and quality and the progress therein.
The Project Approval Board of SSA approves the AW&B for TSG each
year.7.12.8Educational Development Index (EDI). - The EDIs are calculated I
based on a large number of variables derived from the DISE data. EDIs for each
district clearly indicate the journey a district has to traverse to reach the
overall goal of Universalisation of Elementary Education (UEE). A study I of
the related parameters provide adequate insight for prioritizing interventions
and activities for improving elementary education in the District/State, as
well as monitoring parameters that have low EDI value. I Efforts should be
made by the States to develop sub-district & school based EDIs.7.12.9In order
to monitor progress on above aspects, SSA would strengthen its existing multi-
tier monitoring system. However, in doing so, it should be ensured that
teachers, CRPs and BRPs etc. are not burdened with the responsibility of
information collection and collation so that they can focus on children's
learning with equitable quality. The whole lot of information gathered at the
grassroots need not pass through ail levels of management right up to the top.
Rather, each level should focus only on the information that is relevant at
that particular level. This would enable SSA in decentralisation and
delegation not only for monitoring but for follow-up action as well to bridge
any gaps and address impediments in time and in appropriate manner.7.13Quality
Monitoring Tools7.13.1A set of quality monitoring tools have been developed in
collaboration with NCERT to provide half yearly and annual information on
several quality related indices of RTE-SSA covering the following:(i)Student
enrollment and actual attendance(ii)Pupil achievement levels(iii)Teacher
availability and teacher training(iv)Classroom Practices(v)Academic
supervisions of schools by Cluster and Block Resource Centres(vi)Community
perceptions of school functioning States should make efforts to ensure that
data generated by QMT is in the public domain.7.14Funding for Research,
Evaluation, Monitoring and Supervision (REMS)7.14.1A total provision of up to
Rs. 2000 per school per year has been made for research, evaluation,
monitoring and super vision (REMS). Out of this amount, Rs. 500 per school
will be available at the National level. Rs. 50 per school will be available
for monitoring the programme by NCPCR from the National Level. And another Rs.
50 per school will be available for SCPCR from the State level which should be
pooled together for implementing the approved activities. The Executive
Committee of the State SSA Mission will decide on the division of resources at
various levels, from the State to the school from the balance Rs. 1450 per
school. The funds for monitoring will be used for carrying out the following
activities:(i)Creating a pool of resource persons at national, state,
district, sub district level for effective-field based
monitoring.(ii)Providing support to the NCPCR and SCPCR for protecting the
rights of the child under the RTE Act.(iii)Generating community based
data.(iv)Conducting achievement tests, evaluations, studies etc.(v)Undertaking
research activities, including, action research.(vi)Setting up special task
force for low female literacy districts and for special monitoring of girls,
SCs, STs.(vii)Incurring expenditure on DISE(viii)Providing travel grant and a
modest honorarium (as per State specific norm) to resource persons for
monitoring.(ix)Undertaking contingent expenditure for visual monitoring
systems(x)Supporting formulation and activities of assessment/appraisal
teams.(xi)Analysing data at various levels.7.14.2States would need to give
priority to developing and implementing, monitoring systems to measure quality
related outcomes, such as students learning outcomes, teacher performance,
student and teacher attendance rates by gender and social categories, as also
parameters for measuring changes in classroom practices, impact of teacher
training, efficacy of textbooks and textual materials, quality of academic
supervision provided by BRCs/ CRCs/ DIETs etc.7.14.3State and district
provisioning will include inter alia for DISE, allocations for regular school
mapping/micro planning for location of schools, other school infrastructure
and updating of household data on 6-14 year old children's educational
status.(i)Involvement of State SCERTs, DIETs and SIEMATs (where SIEMATs are
functional), will be mandatory in the execution of this
component.(ii)Involvement of other independent national and State level
resource institutions in conducting REMS activities should been couraged
through appropriate MOUs/contracts(iii)Each State /UT RTE-SS A Mission will
set up a Research Approval Committee for processing and approving all research
and evaluation studies to be undertaken at the State level. Appropriate
mechanisms should also be set up for district level by the State SSA.(iv)SSA
would encourage independent research and supervision by autonomous research
institutions. Institutions of proven excellence have been requested to take up
State specific responsibilities.The focus in partnership with institutions
will also be on developing capacities through the interaction in SCERTs /
SIEMATs/DIETs to carry out research and evaluation tasks. Faculty / Department
of Education in Universities would also be requested to participate in such
activities under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The Regional Institutes of
Education (RIE) of NCERT will also be associated in these tasks.

### 8\. Protection Of Child Rights Through Grievance Redressal And Monitoring.

\- 8.1 Introduction8.1.1The RTE which came into effect in April 2010 mandates
that the implementation of the rights enshrined in this Act be monitored by
the NCPCR and the corresponding SCPCRs [Section 31]. This is a radical new
feature and sets a precedent in the legislative history of India, wherein an
autonomous neutral body has been charged with monitoring the implementation of
a fundamental right. It presents a great opportunity to institute a system of
independent monitoring that ensures that the entitlements guaranteed in the
Constitution are indeed being provided to the rights holders. At the same
time, it poses a huge challenge as it involves building a.system that is able
to receive feedback from the last child and respond to it in a manner that
ensures the rights are indeed protected.8.1.2The RTE is the latest addition to
the legal instruments being used by the Government of India for guaranteeing
development in a right based framework. The basic premise of this approach is
an expectation that the delivery of a service hitherto inadequate or
inefficient will be aligned to meet the demands of the people and be in
conformity with their rights under the law. This premise makes two
assumptions: a) that the people know their rights under the law and are able
to demand them and b) that the system of delivery responds to their demands in
an efficient and effective manner. Further, the existence of an independent
monitoring agency provides an additional institutional space for ensuring
rights. Together all three features if adequately institutionalised can ensure
that the rights of the child under RTE are enforced in the manner
intended.8.1.3It is worth pointing out here that grievance redressal and
monitoring while separate functions are interdependent. In other words, the
absence of a grievance redressal system implies that monitoring in a right
framework would necessarily entail intervention of the judiciary. A well
managed grievance redressal mechanism on the other hand allows for monitoring
to be effective through interaction with the system rather than the judiciary.
This means that for SSA to function effectively in the era of RTE, it will
need to develop links with both the grievance redressal as well as monitoring
structures mandated under the Act.8.2Grievance Redressal under the RTE Act. -
8.2.1 The RTE Act has made local authorities the grievance redressal agencies
and the SCPCRs the appellate bodies at the State level. In this context, it is
necessary to establish the modalities through which violations can be dealt
with. A well defined institutional mechanism for grievance redressal involves
a system of registering , investigating and responding within a well-appointed
time frame. This will have to be done along with the implementation agency
which is charged with the actual redressal of the grievance by ensuring that
the right under consideration is actually restored.8.2.2Given below are some
of the issues that need to be addressed for establishing such a mechanism:

### 1\. List the set of legal entitlements guaranteed in the Act and make this
information widely available and publicly displayed.

### 2\. Designate officers responsible for providing each of these legal
entitlements. For grievances against these entitlements the supervising
officer would then be responsible for redressal. This information should also
be made publicly available - on school walls or Panchayat walls.

### 3\. Designate person or persons, who have been authorised by the State
Governments hear grievances under RTE. These person/s would typically be from
the department of education and available at district/block/panchayat level.

### 4\. Specify a time schedule for disposing-off grievances, keeping the
nature of the grievance in mind keeping 3 months as the maximum period as
specified in Section 32 of the Act. Some grievances such as related to
corporal punishment or admission must be disposed off in a shorter time frame

### 5\. Overhaul the system of record management. Provide for a system of
registering grievances at both the district and sub-district levels. The local
authority may appoint an individual from the Education department to register
grievances and issue receipts, ensuring that this officer is not the person
against whom the grievance is being registered. The office should display
number of complaints received, handled, status, action taken on a regular
basis.

### 6\. If the concerned grievance redressal authority considers that it is in
the best interest of the complainant/child to preserve confidentiality, they
may not disclose the identity of the complainant.

### 7\. Registration of grievances should be permitted using different modes
such as postal, telephone, internet, in person etc. A prescribed format may be
provided, but should not be mandatory. A receipt of the grievance, giving the
date, the time frame within which the grievance would be dealt with, and the
contact details of the person responsible for dealing with the grievance, must
form part of the process of registering grievances. The receipt should also
contain details of whom to appeal in case the grievance is not dealt with in
the time frame specified. A prescribed format could be prepared for the
receipt as well.

### 8\. If the grievance cannot be redressed at the level of the local
authority it must be forwarded to the appropriate authority within a specified
time frame.

### 9\. A copy of the grievance should be sent to (and recorded at) the SCPCR
or REPA as well and linked to the MIS.

### 10\. Keeping the grievance and schedule in mind an investigation should be
conducted involving an official of the Education Department/SSA management,
senior to the one against whom the complaint is registered.

### 11\. The process of investigation must allow the complainant as well as
the accused to be heard, and should be conducted as far as possible publicly.

### 12\. The result of the investigation must be conveyed to the complainant
in writing and must recommend redressal by the officer charged with providing
the entitlement within a specified time frame, in line with the schedule for
redressal.

### 13\. SCPCRs have been made the first appellate authority. Rules for how
they are to discharge this function still need to be specified. Are they the
final authority on grievances? How do their decisions impact the redressing
officers/ department needs to be clarified.

### 14\. The State Government should frequently review the nature of
complaints that are being received and take corrective steps, so as to prevent
hearing additional grievances in future. In other words, grievances monitoring
should trigger policy/programme review at the systemic level.

8.2.3Some implications of the above for SSA are:(i)The Education Department
should clearly allocate responsibilities of the SSA and local authorities in
firming up the mechanism through which grievances will be addressed. Once such
a mechanism is in place, it will be possible for the monitoring agencies also
to direct complaints to the appropriate levels. For instance, if a case of
corporal punishment is brought to the notice of NCPCR, it is important for
NCPCR to know who to direct the issue to, or what is the system by which such
a rights violation is/ will be dealt with and at what level.(ii)Enforcing
rights under RTE involves interdepartmental links covering schools established
by other departments such as Tribal Affairs or Social Justice and Welfare.
Grievances that arise from these schools will also have to be redressed by the
State Education Department/SSA which is the appropriate government under the
Act responsible for ensuring provision of elementary education irrespective of
who runs the schools. Thus, the grievance redressal mechanism will have to
include coordination with these departments as well.(iii)Similar links will
also have to be established for covering Specified Category Schools and
Private schools.8.3What can NCPCR Monitor. - 8.3.1 Section 31 of the Act
clearly states that the NCPCR, along with their State counterparts will be
responsible for monitoring the rights of the child under the RTE Act. A closer
look at what exactly is to be monitored reveals that NCPCR will have to look
at children and their rights violations in two domains:

### 1\. Children who are out-of-school, and

### 2\. Children in school

8.3.2For Children out-of-school, monitoring will involve looking at
children:(a)In Rural Areas (children residing in village)(i)Never
enrolled(ii)Dropped out(iii)Temporarily Absent(b)In Rural areas (children
residing outside village)(i)Permanent migrants(ii)Seasonal migrants(iii)In
Observation homes, shelter homes, hostels(c)In Urban
Areas(i)Street/Homeless(ii)Seasonal Migrants(iii)In observation homes, shelter
homes(iv)Child labour8.3.3For Children in-school, monitoring will involve
looking at the following issues:(d)For Children in Government
Schools(i)Provision of neighbourhood school

### 1\. Requisite number of classrooms

### 2\. Appropriate PTR

### 3\. School hours

### 4\. Instructional hours of Teachers

### 5\. Infrastructure

(ii)Access to school

### 1\. Physical

### 2\. Social

(iii)Admission process

### 1\. Denials

### 2\. Capitation fee

### 12\. Other expenses

(v)Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation

### 1\. No annual Exam

### 2\. No failure

### 3\. No detention

### 4\. Prescribed curriculum and books

### 5\. Prescribed system of evaluation

### 6\. Adherence to Constitutional values

(vi)Classroom Transaction

### 1\. No discrimination

### 2\. No corporal punishment

### 3\. Appropriate Teaching methods

### 4\. Appropriate Evaluation Systems

(vii)School Management Committee

### 1\. Appointments as per rules

### 2\. Regular meetings

### 3\. Teacher Accountability

### 4\. Preparation of School Development Plan

### 5\. Other Responsibilities

(e)For Children in Private Aided Schools(i)Reservation for children from
Weaker Sections and Disadvantaged Groups in proportion with aid(f)For Children
in Private Unaided Schools(i)25% reservation for children from Weaker Sections
and Disadvantaged Groups(g)For Children in Specified category Schools [KV,
Navodaya and Sainik schools](i)25% reservation for children from Weaker
Sections and Disadvantaged Groups.8.3.4In addition, as Section 31 states that
safeguarding all of the children's rights is the responsibility of the
Commission, the following areas of the Grievance Redressal System will also
come under the purview of NCPCR:(a)Registration of Complaints (b)
Investigation of Complaints (c) Response to Complaints(d)Appeal
Process8.4Principles of Monitoring. - 8.4.1 The basic principles adopted by
NCPCR in its approach to monitoring are as follows:(i)That the most effective
monitoring can and must be done at the local level by the rights-holders
themselves, albeit through an institutionalised mechanism. The SMCs are in
fact the ideal unit for a monitoring mechanism at the ground level. NCPCR will
therefore gear its efforts towards trying to establish links with the SMCs in
grounding a monitoring system. The SCPCRs must also build similar
linkages.(ii)Awareness generation of the entitlements of the Act and the
ledressal mechanisms that exist is the first and necessary step towards
monitoring. Therefore, creating that awareness would also be the part of the
initial interventions undertaken by NCPCR in building an environment for
concurrent monitoring involving the people. Collaboration with Government
Departments and civil society groups is desirable to make this a well
orchestrated and successful endeavour.(iii)Capacity Building of SMCs and civil
society groups that can assist NCPCR in monitoring and conveying feed back to
NCPCR is also a basic plank of NCPCR's efforts in establishing a monitoring
framework. Linking with the SSA structures, CRCs and BRCs would be useful in
this exercise.8.4.2NCPCR has put the following systems into place to undertake
its tasks in monitoring:(i)RTE Division at NCPCR, focused on issues related to
RTE. This Division located at New Delhi will coordinate all of NCPCR's
monitoring activities.(ii)State Representatives appointed by NCPCR to act as
"eyes and ears" in the States. At least two persons have been appointed in
each State to assist the NCPCR in receiving feedback from the States on the
status of implementation of RTE. The State Representatives will
also(a)coordinate a network of civil society groups at the State level through
which feedback on status o f i m p l e m e n t a t i o n c a n b e received
and conveyed both to State governments and NCPCR; and(b)initiated Dialogue
with State governments on RTE.(iii)Identify District and Block Resource
Persons and organisations over a period of 2 years, who will be trained to
assist the State Representatives and NCPCR in monitoring.(iv)Initiate Social
Monitoring (Audits) with the help of civil society groups, SMCs and citizens
to help develop a system by which local structures (SMCs) and the people
themselves can monitor the implementation of the programme and send period
reports to the NCPCR/ SCPCR.(v)Hold Public Hearings which have shown to be a
powerful tool used by the NCPCR for highlighting violation of child rights in
a public forum. Public Hearings focused on RTE will be used by the Commission
to draw the attention of State Governments to issues that arise with respect
to RTE.(vi)Collaborate with Civil Society Networks as part of NCPCR's efforts
to receive feedback from across the country. In particular, the following
mechanisms will be employed through the networks:(a)Use of Monitoring
Checklists on RTE compliance(b)Publicity and Awareness of Entitlements under
RTE and Role of NCPCR(c)SMC Training on monitoring(vii)Complaints Management
at NCPCR through(a)a Complaints Management System [CMS] through which
complaints are received and processed at NCPCR.(b)helpline, which will allow
citizens to call in and receive information and register complaints.(c)both of
the above will need to be closely linked with the implementation structure
within Education Departments/SSA structures to be effective.(viii)Research and
Data Collection on specific issues related to monitoring and grievance
redressal.(ix)Recommendations to Central and State Governments, such as: (a)
Guidelines on Corporal Punishment and Discrimination(x)Legal Action.(xi)RTE
Compliance Reports from the States.8.5Summing Up. - 8.5.1 The Grievance
Redressal and Monitoring aspects of RTE implementation are new areas that the
SSA structure will have to contend with as it functions as the vehicle for
delivering elementary education in the RTE phase. It involves dealing with new
institutions such as the NCPCR/SCPCRs as well as the "local authorities",
which have been given a role in monitoring and grievance redressal. It also
involves developing links with other government departments such as Tribal
Affairs, Social Justice and Labour. The success of the Act will depend greatly
on how well these linkages are established by the SSA machinery. It may be
worth pointing out that the sooner these linkages are established the better,
as the momentum generated by the passage of the Act must not be lost. The
coordinated working of all aspects of implementation, grievance redressal and
monitoring will be essential to ensure that the pressure on enforcing rights
is maintained.

### 9\. Planning, Appraisal And Fund Flow Mechanisms - 9.1 Planning and
Development of Comprehensive Work Plans

9.1.1Approach. - The previous chapters, particularly those pertaining to
Access, Equity, Quality and Participation in the context of RTE Act,
adequately bring out the challenges in planning for UEE. The biggest challenge
is to have an integrated approach to synthesise and integrate the wide variety
of provisions, strategies and interventions, which go not only beyond the
ambit of SSA but of the traditional functions of department of education as
well. To address this challenge, planning in SSA needs a transformation and a
shift in approach. This shift will be characterised by an understanding of the
inherent relationship between access, equity, retention, and quality, and
strengthening this relationship to derive benefits for common goal of UEE.
Convergence for intersectoral support to address the complex issues of equity
and exclusion would be its fundamental feature. Planning under SSA must
therefore be exhaustive, and should cover:(i)Areas for policy /systemic
reforms in elementary education mandated by RTE(ii)Areas for specific
provisioning under SSA for access, quality, equity, school infrastructure,
community mobilization, monitoring and supervision, management structures as
envisaged under the RTE Act.(iii)Areas for convergent action in collaboration
with other schemes of the Central and State Governments for (i) and (ii)
above, and(iv)Areas for partnerships with NGOs and other civil society
organisations.9.1.2For right based planning to succeed in its objectives, it
is essential that SSA functionaries are able to visualise and reflect on
different provisions, strategies and intervention as organically integrated
leading to UEE. Universal access for example, should not be seen merely as
opening of schools or providing hostels. Instead, it should be seen as a
product /function of a range of diverse provisions, strategies and
interventions, like, policy on opening of schools, mapping for physical and
social access, opening of schools, providing adequate infrastructure of
acceptable quality, availability of teachers, removing financial and
procedural barriers. Planning for access would also extend to relevant child
centred curriculum, text book, inclusive environment, participatory classroom
processes with enabling and empowering assessment systems. Community support
and participation, is also an integral part of planning for access which
should eventually lead to ownership.9.1.3While some of the above strategies
and interventions also support participation, retention and quality, planners
for universal access would have to take all these factors into account in
order to prepare a comprehensive outcome oriented plan for universal
access.9.1.4Similarly, equity should not be seen only in reference to access
or enrollment, to be merely addressed through isolated interventions, such as
innovation funds and NPEGEL etc. Instead equity should be viewed as a cross
cutting theme. Exclusion has multifaceted manifestations, and would require a
comprehensive and coherent approach. Planning for equity would, therefore,
encompass amalgamation of interventions leading to inclusion in access as well
as participation in classroom processes, retention and quality. It would also
necessitate planning for curriculum and textbook revision to address the
inequity and exclusion therein. Planning for space and respect for child's
gender, ethnicity, religion, caste, culture, language, geographic location,
political milieu, familial occupation, economic status, special needs etc.
within every component and facet of school education, all need to synthesise
in a plan for universal equity.9.1.5Obviously, the intended approach shift to
planning would materialise only if the AWP&B submitted under SSA are actually
District Plans for UEE with not only integration of strategies and
interventions of SSA but interplay, coherence and consolidation of objectives
of access, equity and quality as well as intersectoral
dimensions.9.1.6Formulation of State/UT Plans under SSA will be a
comprehensive exercise covering all the above aspects, and will not be
restricted to SSA provisioning alone. SSA will reflect the additional resource
provision for UEE; its programme parameters have been revised in accordance
with the provisions of the RTE Act. Hence, it is imperative that the annual
work plan & budgets, (AWP&B) formulated under SSA should factor in investments
from relevant central schemes such as Teacher Education, Drinking Water
Mission, Total Sanitation Campaign, Mid-day Meal and also from State schemes.
In this way, the AWP&B can enable holistic planning for elementary education
for implementation of the RTE Act (2009). The AWP&B of each district should
also reflect all the investments made from different sources for elementary
education.9.1.7The RTE Act mandates several substantive reforms that are
systemic in nature. States/UTs would need to issue appropriate rules and
government orders for implementing the entire gamut of provisions pertaining
to, inter alia, duties of teachers; non-deployment of teachers in non-teaching
duties except as specified in the Act; removal of all barriers to school
admission including financial and procedural ones; ban on physical punishment
and mental harassment; CCE, non-detention and non-expulsion of the student in
the elementary grades etc. Thus, planning in SSA needs to be enriched by
indicating the trajectory of planned systemic reforms in elementary education
with timelines in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act (2009).
Further, the Plan should also inform as to how the overwhelming need for
capacity building of stakeholders at different levels will be met.9.2Community
Based Planning Process. - 9.2.1 SSA envisages decentralised, need based and
participatory planning in a bottom - up approach. Planning for UEE would inter
alia focus on planning for universal access, equity, participation and
quality.9.2.2A School Management Committee (SMC) will be constituted for all,
except unaided, schools, as per Section 21 of the RTE Act. The SMC comprising
parents, local authority and school teachers is expected to be the fulcrum of
the school based planning process as envisaged in the RTE Act. The SMC will be
required to prepare a School Development Plan [Section 21(2) (b)] that will
form the basis for grants to be made to the school [Section
22(2)].9.2.3Ideally, the School Development Plan should emerge from a process
of micro- planning undertaken in a participatory manner in respect of all
habitations falling within the catchment area of the 'neighbourhood' school.
The preparation of the School Development Plan may be undertaken by a core
team, led by an SMC member from the village/habitation, and comprising
selected community leaders, NGO representatives, Head Teacher, selected
teachers and parents, especially parents of children from disadvantaged groups
and weaker sections, and children with special needs.9.2.4The process of
micro-planning would involve intensive interaction and dialogue with each
household in the habitations falling with in the catchment area of the
'neighbourhood' school, and would include, inter alia the following steps: (i)
environment building in the village/urban units through kala jathas, (ii)
conduct of a household survey to identify children in each household, and
their participation/ non-participation in school, (iv) preparation of a
village/school education register, (v) preparation of a village map and its
analysis to the people in a gram sabha, (vi) preparation of a proposal' for
improved education facilities in the village. The steps mentioned above are
suggestive and application of the same may need to be adjusted to the field
situation e.g. in urban areas children may be attending a particular schools
from outside the defined neighbourhood, or some children may be attending
private aided or unaided schools in the vicinity. The SMC would need to factor
in these locale specific variations while conducting the micro-planning
exercise.9.2.5The School Development Plan is visualised as a comprehensive
plan focusing on all aspects of school e.g. protection of children's rights,
infrastructure, classroom processes, Inclusiveness, and, CCE etc. While
maintaining this vision, the SDP would have to prioritise its needs in the
light of urgency and the available resources etc. Stakeholders at various
levels would have to be sensitised to this approach shift to school based
planning. This would help them to appreciate the spirit behind the concept of
SDP and to facilitate its formulation and implementation.9.2.6SMCs may require
training to conduct micro-planning and household survey, prepare the SDP and
ensure that all children are enrolled in schools, are attending and, track
their progress till they complete elementary education. Besides, orientation
on key principles of quality including, CCE, they may also need training in
areas such as systematic development and maintenance of school infrastructure,
so that the school meets the RTE requirements within three years of
commencement of the Act. Also, capacities at State and local authority levels
need to be strengthened for such holistic and convergent
planning.9.2.7Following the micro-planning exercise, the blocks and districts
should undertake an exercise to see which requirements can be fulfilled either
by redeployment/rationalisation of existing resources or through other schemes
of the Central/State Governments. For example, in many cases the expected PTR
at school level can be ensured by rational teacher redeployment, instead of
undertaking fresh teacher recruitment. The SDP may be appraised by the Cluster
level units, in consultation with the Block teams. The District unit will
appraise the Block level plans which will form the basis of the district plan.
Due care should be taken to ensure that the demand for teachers, classrooms,
etc. are as per the broad norms for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and RTE
stipulations.9.3Annual Work Plan and Budgets (AWP&B). - 9.3.1 The RTE Act
provides time lines for meeting certain standards that it has prescribed. For
example, the Schedule of the Act provides a three year window for creating and
developing the infrastructure as well as availability of teachers. Similarly,
a five year timeline has been set for ensuring that all teachers are
professionally qualified. Thus, States in their Plan shall reflect how they
are planning to meet the timeline. Within these timelines, annual plans are to
be prepared focusing on the gaps and the available resources (e.g. funds,
adequately qualified and experienced human resource, capacities etc.) to meet
these gaps. Similarly, in respect of quality and equity aspects, while
maintaining vision and long term and medium term goals, States and districts
shall set differentiated, need based annual targets and plan for achieving
them.9.3.2The Annual Plans will, thus, be a need based prioritised Plan, based
on a broad indication of resource availability to a district in a particular
year. The National/ State Mission will appraise these Annual Plans and changes
in keeping with resource availability could be effected by the National/State
Mission. As stated earlier, these Plans have to be as per broad norms under
SSA. The appraisal teams would ensure that planning is differentiated, need
based as per norms and within the provisions of the RTE Act.9.3.3Preparation
of Annual Plans requires creation of capacities at all levels. Besides the
teams of resource persons from the National and State missions, efforts to
develop State specific institutional linkage for planning support will also be
made. Consultation with research institutions for undertaking State specific
educational agenda has already been initiated. The same would be finalised in
consultation with the State Governments. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan would
require support of institutions of proven excellence for research, evaluation,
monitoring and capacity building.9.3.4Quality and equity would be the
overarching theme of planning and plan formulation in the overall perspective
of child rights and entitlements. Thus, the focus should clearly be on the
following;• Strategies to address discrimination against marginalised groups
(Girls, SC, ST, Muslim minorities, CWSN) systemically and in all aspects
including classroom practice, teacher behaviour, peer relations and use of
school spaces and facilities.• Plan for undertaking curriculum reform to
ensure that all children participate in the learning process; this would
encompass age appropriate syllabus formulation, text book and supplementary
material development, teacher training, interactive classroom processes,
review of existing assessment systems vis-a-vis continuous and comprehensive
evaluation system in consonance with the NPE 1986/92, NCF-2005 and the
principles in section 29 of RTE Act.9.3.5The quality of the planning exercise
will be greatly augmented by the involvement of CRCs and BRCs. CRCs and BRCs
have to be carefully nurtured to provide capacity for effective planning by
the SMCs. The starting point in any such exercise is for the States to accept
the need for careful selection of personnel preferably from the existing
governmental functionaries, so that a permanent pool of persons who understand
elementary education is always available to the State within the sector. If
adequate numbers of persons are not available from within the government
system, persons may be selected and appointed on contract from the management
costs provided under the SSA. The National /State Mission will have a role in
role in selection of personnel in order to ensure objectivity in such
processes.9.3.6The District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) have
a Planning and Management unit. These units have to become fully operational.
The effort at entering into Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with State
Governments under the scheme of Strengthening Teacher Education was a step in
that direction.9.3.7As stated in earlier sections, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
encourages institutional capacity development at all levels. While support
from MHRD for capacity building at State and district levels would continue
with the help of institutions like NCERT, NUEPA and TSG, Ultimately, no amount
of external supervision by capacity building teams or monitoring teams is a
substitute for institutional capacity development at all levels. The CRCs,
BRCs and DIETs have a large role in the preparation of perspective and Annual
Plans and their systematic capacity development has to be a priority in
programme implementation.9.4Use of DISE in Planning. - 9.4.1 While the SDP
should be prepared based on the latest and most relevant data from school and
from the community for the preparation of annual plans at the district level,
the DISE data shall be used effectively. Every district shall have an EMIS
unit. One of the main data systems of this unit will be the school based
annual information system called District Information System for Education
(DISE) and household survey reports. The data compiled through the aforesaid
systems should be utilised for planning; DISE based information and analysis
throwing light on infrastructure, access, retention, quality, teacher related
issues shall be used in the process of planning and even monitoring,
evaluation and mid-course corrections. Teachers' rationalisation,
prioritisation of physical infrastructure and teachers' training issues may be
addressed with the help of DISE data. DISE data also provides information on
dropout, retention, promotion and transition rates. These flow rates should be
used at the District and Block level to identify and pin point the problem
areas affecting the flow rates. The analysed data should be shared at the
local level which will help the planning to prepare effective and need based
plans.9.4.2DISE data should encompass and collect information from all schools
irrespective of its type, recognised or un-recognised, and Government, or
Private. The States should move towards a unified system of data for
elementary level, the on going parallel systems should amalgamate with
DISE.9.4.3The National University of Educational Planning & Administration
(NUEPA) has developed an Educational Development Index (EDI) to track progress
of the States towards Universal Elementary Education (UEE), for Primary and
Upper Primary levels as well as for a composite picture of Elementary
Education. The States shall develop Educational Development Index (EDI) for
the district and sub-districts levels. The EDI ranking will encourage the
States and the districts to improve their performance and have a closer look
at both the inputs and the outputs of the parameters that affect elementary
education. Educational Development index (EDIs) for each district should be
calculated and should be taken into cognizance while preparing the district
AWP&Bs and their appraisals. The EDI for a district indicates the journey a
district is to traverse to reach the overall goal of Universal Elementary
Education (UEE) in the context of RTE. A study of the related parameters would
provide adequate insight to prioritise the activities which will ultimately
improve the elementary education scenario in the district/State. It is
expected that EDI will also enable more effective targeting of Sarva Shiksha
Abhiyan (SSA) to the neediest regions.9.5Special Focus Districts. - 9. 5.1
While taking in to account the infrastructure gap and other disparities, SSA
recognises the intra-regional, inter-State and inter-district disparities and
is making efforts to address them. A crucial step in this direction is
identification of Special Focus Districts (SFDs). These districts are
identified based on indicators like concentration of out of school children,
high gender gap, low retention rate and infrastructure gap as well as
concentration of SC/ST/Minority population. School buildings and classrooms
are sanctioned on need basis to these districts on priority, besides focused
scrutiny during Appraisal. Classification of SFDs has been dynamic and
contingent on context, need and priority. The same approach for classification
will continue under SSA - RTE as well. States need to facilitate preparation
of AWP&B for SFD in order to ensure that the needs and gaps are appropriately
identified and strategies and interventions to address them are adequately
planned for. After the PAB approvals, States need to continuously monitor
implementation in SFDs.9.6Urban Planning. - 9.6.1 Urban areas have unique
features like a high density of population, a heterogeneous community,
extremely high cost/unavailability of land, slums, migrating population,
homeless population, infrastructural barriers to school, urban deprived
children etc. As such, planning in the context of RTE would also be somewhat
different warranting relevant and more specific strategies especially while
planning for school access (physical as well as social), special training,
community participation, classroom processes, academic support and convergence
etc.9.6.2The most critical factors while planning for neighbourhood schools in
urban areas would be finalising relevant and need based criteria for
neighbourhood school and interface between school and community. Experience
has shown that in cities, the schools are mostly planned in the main
city/municipal area whereas the communities from which most of the children
come to these schools are increasingly pushed towards city fringes, slums and
unauthorised localities. As a result, children studying in a government school
in the municipal areas may actually be coming from far off places, and a
mechanical identification of neighbourhood and habitation served by the
school, the assessment of enrollment gaps, community needs, soliciting
community participation may all fall out of context. Community participation,
formation of SMCs and formulation of SDP would necessarily have to appreciate
and address these very specific issues in order to prepared relevant and
rights based plan. Land would necessarily have to be earmarked for school in
all the upcoming colonies for ensuring neighbourhood school. In order to
retain children from migrating groups and communities, class room processes
would have to be inclusive enough to facilitate and integrate children with
varying back grounds, languages and cultures as many children may belong not
only to different districts but even to different states.9.6.3Similarly,
Special Training would have to be planned very specifically to address the
needs of urban deprived children like street and working children, rag-picking
children, children of slum/pavement dwellers, children working in industry,
household, tea shops, garages etc. as these children not only have lost
certain number of years of schooling, they often are in desperate need of care
and protection. As such the realisation of their right to education is
contingent on their rights to life and protection from abuse. Effective
convergence with municipal agencies and departments of labour (particularly to
address issues of child labour) health, PHE, welfare, WCD etc as well as
schemes like JNURM, ICPS as well as NGOs would be a necessary precondition for
access and retention of urban deprived children.9.6.4Committed staff and
experts would be required to undertake such focused and rigorous planning in
SSA. For this to happen, urban planning cells in the SPOs and in metro cities
as well as urban resource groups at state and at metro city levels would be a
pre-requisite.9.6.5There are numerous examples of urban specific planning
pertaining to different components that can be referred to for planning the
implementation of RTE Act in urban areas. The City Level Plan of Action
(CLPoA) a joint effort by government agencies and several NGOs in Kolkata
undertook an impressive mapping and need assessment exercise followed by
bridging interventions to facilitate access for urban deprived children. CLPoA
experience can be a significant and useful reference for cities that intend to
undertake micro-planning and mapping exercise. Similarly, successful
integration of children belonging to disadvantaged groups with ordinary school
going children as demonstrated through the experience of Loreto Convent in
Sealdah is a good model to refer to. Rationalisation of schools undertaken
some years ago in the cities of Jabalpur (M.P.) and Lucknow (U.P.) to address
the gapes in access to school, and, operation of BRC & CRC for sub-district
academic support and training in the city of Chennai (Tamil Nadu) are some
more examples for urban specific planning.9.6.6Urban specific strategies
should reflect in the entire district Annual Work Plan under SSA. The cities
with large population (one million and above) shall make separate plans, while
for other cities and urban areas, urban component shall be a separate chapter
of every district plan. The State component too shall clearly focus on urban
issues.9.6.7Major cities would need a dedicated programme management structure
at city level to plan and implement SSA in the urban context. An urban
planning cell established at State as well as at district level will
facilitate focused planning and implementation. Further. Urban resource groups
(URG) at State and district levels, consisting of representatives from
different Government agencies, NGOs and other sections of civil society, would
provide forums for consultations to improve urban planning and formulation of
AWP&B.9.7Planning for Capacity Building of Education Administrators to
Facilitate Implementation of the RTE Act. - 9.7.1 The RTE Act provides for
children's right to free and compulsory admission, attendance and completion
of elementary education. It would be critical, therefore, to consider aspects
that prevent children from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, as also
girls, from completing elementary education. Secondly, the Act provides for
the child's right to education that is free from fear, stress and anxiety.
There are several provisions in the Act, including for example, provisions
prohibiting corporal punishment, detention and expulsion which need to be fore
-fronted in S S A interventions to ensure that we move towards a system that
provides a warm, welcoming and encouraging approach for children to learn. The
most important aspect, however, is to ensure that the teaching learning
process is free from stress and anxiety (Section 29), and SSA would need to
ensure curricular reform in consonance with NCF- 2005. In the context of
curricular reform, there are several testing and school grading systems in
SSA, which need to be reviewed for an understanding of the extent to which
these may demotivate children and lead to dropout. With reference to teachers,
the Act lays down the academic responsibilities of teachers, and teacher
accountability systems under SSA would need to ensure that children are
learning and that their right to learning in an environment that is free from
stress and anxiety is not violated. Also the Act provides that pupil teacher
ratios (PTR) be maintained in each school, and teacher recruitment, transfer
and deployment systems in the States would need re form, and educational
administrators would need to be trained/ re-oriented. SSA provides for
training of educational administrators at all levels and it would be necessary
to undertake re-orientation and training of educational administrators to the
"child rights." In this context, States would have to plan training design and
processes for educational administrators in clear perspective.9.8Components of
a District Plan. - 9.8.1 A District Plan is a plan for universal access though
neighborhood schools, including 25% admission for children from disadvantaged
groups and weaker sections in private schools as stipulated in the RTE Act.
Some of the components and focus areas of such a plan are(i)identification of
out-of-school children and context specific strategy for special training for
them.(ii)a clear equity focus in all the activities under the plan. Every
intervention must be sensitive to gender and social equity concerns.(iii)a
Plan for educational development of children belonging to the Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Minorities, Children with special needs and other
disadvantaged groups.(iv)need based context specific strategies for ensuring
access, retention, participation and quality education for children(v)a plan
for quality education with strategies for capacity building of teachers and
trainers; academic support structure, learning enhancement programmes,
classroom processes and continuous Comprehensive evaluation and monitoring
mechanism for academic aspects.(vi)strategies for monitoring and eliminating
physical punishment or mental harassment of children in the school,
identification of designated authority for redressal of such complaints.(vii)a
Plan for school development encompassing all aspects of quality and equity
with annual priorities and targets(viii)the District AWP&B should adequately
reflect the block specificities so as to make it more focused, relevant and
need based.9.8.2The district plan should provide evidence of -(a)interface
with elected representatives at all levels.(b)process based and norm based
constitution of committees at each level.(c)evidence of habitation/village
based activities like Bal melas, Jathas, sports, Maa-beti sammelans, etc for
community mobilisation and community ownership of the school development
plan.(e)institutional arrangements for decentralised decision making
consultation with teachers.(f)school mapping and micro-planning habitation
wise/village wise/cluster wise/urban slum wise/ ward wise.(g)availability of
Joint Bank accounts in each school/VEC/School Management Committees to receive
community contribution and to spend government grants.(h)Large scale
participation of women and other disadvantaged groups in the planning
process.(i)Incorporation of issues like local specific school timings,
etc.(j)Reflection of all investments in Plan and Non Plan being made in a
particular district for elementary education.9.8.3The district plan should be
based on a survey and subsequent analysis of(a)available school facilities e.
g. infrastructure, teachers, equipments & materials etc., including non-
governmental educational institutions;(b)0-6 years age group children and
facilities for their education and development;(c)6-14 years age group
children through preparation of Education Registers; and(d)In case,
unrecognised schools are not able to conform to the norms stipulated in the
RTE Act (2009) within the specified timeframe, children in these schools would
need to be admitted to the nearest neighbourhood schools.9.8.4The district
plan would also require an assessment of(a)teacher training needs and survey
of capacities for orientation and training with existing
institutions;(b)school-wise/habitation-wise additional school facilities,
teachers, etc.;(c)school wise/special training centre wise incentives of
meals, scholarships, uniforms, free textbooks and notebooks, etc.;(d)teaching-
learning materials;(e)monitoring and feedback System;(f)available financial
resources and priority of needs;(g)Progress against school development plan;
and(h)Facilities for ECCE.9.9State Component Plan. - 9.9.1 For formulation of
AWP&B of the State Component, SSA would provide support from within the 6%
management cost as well as from the funds for Research, Evaluation, Monitoring
and Supervision (on a per school basis) that is earmarked for state level
activities. The State Component Plan including all activities to be conducted
at the state level must be prepared with a clear budget. The cost of State
level management and capacity building can be built into the State Component
Plan. The State component has to be integrated with the needs of the districts
across the state.9.10Appraisal of District Plans. - 9.10.1 The National /State
Mission will undertake appraisal of the District Plans with the assistance of
resource teams constituted by the operational support unit of the
National/State Mission. These resource persons will be fully oriented for
undertaking the task of appraisal. The Appraisal Missions will imdertake
regular visits to districts in order to monitor the quality of preparatory
activities. The cost of the Appraisal teams will be fully borne by the
National/ State Mission. The monitoring and operational support teams at the
National/ State level Mission will constitute the Appraisal
teams.9.10.2Appraisal teams will be jointly constituted by the National and
the State level Mission. One of the National Mission nominees could be a
representative of the research institution that undertakes responsibility for
that State. The National Mission will circulate a list of resource persons on
the basis of past experience gathered under different educational projects
like DPEP, Lok Jumbish Project and SSA. The nominees of the State Mission will
also have to be approved by the National Mission. A checklist of activities
will be prepared for the guidance of the Appraisal Team. For non-governmental
representatives in appraisal teams, besides the TA/DA as admissible for
Government servants, a modest honorarium will be available. The salient
features of the appraisal process include the following:• To be conducted
jointly by the Central and State government representatives in the initial
phase, along with experts representing NUEPA/NCERT/SCERT/S1EMAT and other
resource organisations• States to undertake appraisal after sufficient
institutional capacities are developed through networking with national level
institutions• Assessment to ensure that mobilisation has been the basis of
planning and plan reflects participatory planning process• Level of community
ownership to be the critical factor in appraisal of plans• Participation of
NGOs, Panchayati Raj Institutions and urban local bodies• Assessment of
community contribution and participation in school activities• Assessment of
institutional arrangements for decentralized decision making and capacity
building in local resource institutions.• Assessment of involvement of
teachers in the planning exercise• Assessment of adherence to spirit and
stipulations of RTE Act.• Assessment of systemic reforms mandated by RTE Act•
Assessment of convergence with relevant Central/State schemes for education
and welfare9.11Allocation of Resources as per Approved Plans and Fund Flow. -
9.11.1 The allocation of resources will depend on the following: preparation
of District Elementary Education Plans and their appraisal; commitment of the
State government with regard to the State share; performance of the State
Government regarding resources made available earlier; institutional reforms
in States to facilitate decentralized management of education and as per RTE
requirements; reports of supervision teams regarding the quality of programme
implementation; and availability of financial resources in a particular year.
The actual allocation of resources will depend on all these factors. It is
likely that districts with poor infrastructure will require more
resources.9.11.2However, the release will also be performance linked. If an
educationally backward district does not utilise the resources in the manner
intended, it is unlikely to continue to receive a priority.9.11.3.The
expenditure on elementary education of a State/UT has to be maintained at the
level of expenditure in 1999-2000-the year of commencement of SSA in the
State. The State share for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has to be over and above the
expenditure already being incurred at the 1999-2000 level in a particular
State. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan will not substitute State funding for elementary
education. In fact, it is expected to encourage States to invest more on
elementary education along side a higher allocation by the Central Government.
The State level Implementation Society for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan will certify
that the level of investments are being maintained in the State, at the time
of seeking further allocation of resources from the Central Government. The
NLM will also monitor expenditure on elementary education. TSG will provide
professional support for regular monitoring of expenditure on elementary
education.9.11.4For procedure for Release of Funds, SSA is conceived as a
partnership between the Central and the State/UT Governments. The procedure
for release of funds incorporates this idea of a partnership. Under the SSA
programme, the districts had prepared their proposals through a community
owned Pre- Project phase, broadly based on the Framework for Implementation.
The State level Implementation Society for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan forwarded
these proposals to the National Mission of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for release
after appraisal by a joint team. The Central Government released the funds
directly to the State Implementation Society. The State Governments were
required to give writ ten commitments regarding their contribution towards the
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.9.11.5After preparation of the District Elementary
Education Plans, the perspective as well as the Annual Plans will be jointly
appraised by a team of experts constituted jointly by the National and the
State level implementation Society. The Governing Council of the National
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Mission has empowered the Project Approval Board under
the chairmanship of the Secretary of the department to approve the Annual Plan
on the basis of the appraisal report, the recommendation of the State
Implementation Society, the availability of Central Plan funds, and the
commitment of the State Government regarding financial resources. There
commendation of the State level Implementation Society must also be
accompanied by a commitment of the State Government to transfer its share to
the State Society within thirty days of the receipt of the Central
contribution, as per the approved sharing arrangement. The release of the
first instalment to the State/UT will be processed after receipt of these
written commitments. The appraisal and approval of Plans should be completed
in time for the first instalment, to meet the proposed expenditure of the
first six months, to be released by 15 April.9.11.6There would be two
instalments each year: one in April for expenditure between April and
September and the second in September for expenditure between October to
March. The Government of India would release an ad-hoc grant in April every
year. (Ref. PAB decision of 88th Meeting held on 6.12.2006) This will be
subsequently adjusted based on the approval of AWP&B for the Year. The second
instalment will be based on the progress in expenditure and the quality of
implementation. The utilisation certificates from the districts to the States
should be submitted as and when the funds are utilised but before the release
of further instalment. The Utilisation Certificates from the State to the
National Mission for funds released in the previous year would become due at
the time of the release of the second instalment in the subsequent
year.9.12Financial provision for Management. - 9.12.1 SSA provides for
Management Costs up to 6 per cent of the total programme cost. For small
districts in the States of the North East Region and Union Territories, SSA
provides up to Rs. 40 lakh subject to the overall ceiling of 6 percent being
maintained at the national level over the project period. The Management Costs
can be used for engaging experts for specific tasks and specific periods, data
collection and DISE operationalisation and maintenance, office expenses like
stationary, telephone, fax, photocopiers consumables, postage, POL, vehicle
hiring, TA/DA of functionaries, cost of persons engaged on contract basis for
the programme duration, recurring contingent and miscellaneous costs. For
specific tasks, experts may be hired for a given time frame, to provide
support to the mainstream educational management structure. Before hiring
experts, it will be mandatory for districts/'States to assess the existing
strength. There would be areas like MIS, Planning, Pedagogy, Teacher Training,
Research and Evaluation, Media and communication activities, Gender
Sensitization, Civil Works, Financial Management, Access, Equity and Special
Training that may require infusion of experts. The actual requirement would
depend on the need determined on the basis of an assessment of the existing
structure. These professionals must work to strengthen capacities of the
mainstream personnel. Adequate, experienced and trained management structure
is necessary at all level for the effective implementation of the
programme.9.12.2Upto 2% is available for Learning Enhancement Programme within
the ceiling of 6% of the Management Cost. Further, up to 0.5% of district
outlay may be utilised for community participation and mobilisation campaign
provided that the management cost and community mobilization, LEP together
does not exceed 6% of the total outlay subject to the conditions prescribed in
the norm.Appendix-INorms For Interventions Access And Retention

1-15/2010-EE-4. - Government of India Ministry of Human Resource Development
Department of School Education & LiteracyDated 23rd November, 2010Subject:
Guidelines under section 35(1) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 regarding procedure for admission in schools under section
13(1) and section 12(l)(c) of the RTE Act-regarding.Section 13(1) of the Right
of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 provides, inter-
alia, that while admitting a child, no school or person shall subject the
child or his/her parents to any 'screening procedure'. Section 2(o) of the RTE
Act defines the term 'screening procedure' to mean the 'method of selection
for admission of a child, in preference over another, other than a random
method'. Further, section 12(l)(c) of the Act provides that unaided schools
and specified category schools shall admit at least 25% of the strength of
class I, children belonging to weaker section and children belonging to
disadvantaged group from the neighbourhood and provide them free and
compulsory education till completion of elementary education. Further, where
the school admits children at pre-primary level, such admissions shall be made
at that level.

### 2\. The Ministry has received representations from several unaided and
aided schools seeking clarification on the procedure to^be followed for
admission. The Ministry held a meeting with various stakeholders on the 14th
August, 2010 to elicit their views for formulating a guideline for admissions,
which would be consistent with the spirit of the RTE Act, specifically with
section 13(1) read with section 2(o) of the Act.

### 3\. The objective of the provisions of section 13(1) read with section
2(o) , is to ensure that schools adopt an admission procedure which is non-
discriminatory, rational and transparent, and that schools do not subject
children and their parents to admission tests and interviews in order to
decide whether they will admit a child or not.Admission tests and interviews
are generally a tool for profiling and eliminating children, and therefore
screening to assess a child's 'intelligence' should be prohibited. The RTE Act
is anchored in the belief that availability of equal educational opportunities
to children belonging to different social and economic background will
reinforce the idea of equality enshrined in our Constitution, and ensure that
children are not discriminated on the basis of social or economic background
or any such criteria. There is need for moving towards composite classrooms
with children from diverse backgrounds, rather than homogenous and exclusivist
schools. It is an academically established point that heterogeneity in the
class room leads to greater creativity.

### 4\. Keeping these objectives in view, the following guidelines are issued
under section 35(1) of the RTE Act, 2009.

(i)With regard to admissions in class I (or pre-primary class as the case may
be) under section 12(l)(c) of the RTE Act in unaided and 'specified category'
schools, schools shall follow a system of random selection out. of the
applications received from children belonging to disadvantaged groups and
weaker sections for filling the pre-determined number of seats in that class,
which should be not less than 25% of the strength of the class.(ii)For
admission to the remaining 75% of the seats (or a lesser percentage depending
upon the number of seats fixed by the school for admission under section 12(1
)(c), in respect of unaided schools and specified category schools, and for
all the seats in the aided schools, each school should formulate a policy
under which admissions are to take place. This policy should include criteria
for categorization of applicants in terms of the objectives of the school on a
rational, reasonable and just basis. There shall be no profiling of the child
based on parental educational qualifications. The policy should be placed by
the school in the public domain, given wide publicity and explicitly stated in
the school prospectus. There shall be no testing and interviews for any
child/parent falling within or outside the categories, and selection would be
on a random basis. Admission should be made strictly on this basis.

### 5\. The aforementioned guideline should be brought to the knowledge of all
concerned for necessary compliance.

This issues with the approval of the competent authority.Annexure-5National
Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level

### 1\. Background. - 1.1 The National Programme for Education of Girls at
Elementary Level (NPEGEL) was introduced in 2003 as an amendment to the Scheme
of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) for providing additional components for
education of girls at elementary level. NPEGEL had been formulated for
education of under privileged/ disadvantaged girls from class I to VIII as a
separate and distinct gender component plan of SSA. The gender component is
necessary to achieve UEE for girls in educationally backward areas.

1.2In subsequent years, several changes were brought in the NPEGEL
interventions. With the RTE Act, 2009 coming into force with effect from 1st
April 2010, and the SSA Framework of Implementation being revised to
correspond to the RTE Act, the NPEGEL component of SSA would also be
implemented in the overall context of child rights and child entitlements and
in harmony with the spirit and stipulations of the Act.

### 2\. Objectives. - 2.1 There exists significant gender gap in enrolment at
the elementary level, which is very acute for girls belonging to the
Scheduled. Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other disadvantaged groups. Reduction
in the gender gap would require a concerted focus on the hard-to-reach groups.
Therefore, it is necessary to include certain interventions addressing the
specific education needs of girls. The objectives of NPEGEL are:

(a)To provide for block-focused projects for girls at risk and girls in
difficult circumstances with clearly defined outcomes.(b)To develop and
promote facilities to provide access, facilitate retention of girls and ensure
greater participation of women and girls in the field of elementary
education(c)To improve the quality of elementary education through gender
specific interventions and to stress upon the relevance and quality of girls'
education for their empowerment

### 3\. Scope and applicability. - 3.1 NPEGEL is applicable in the following
areas:-

(a)Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs): previously defined on a composite
criteria of blocks with a rural female literacy rate below the national
average (46.13%: Census 2001) and gender gap in literacy higher than the
national average (21.59%: Census 2001).(b)Blocks of districts which have at
least 5% SC/ ST population and SC/ ST female literacy rate below
10%(c)Selected urban slums.

### 4\. Focus. - 4.1 The focus of NPEGEL will be to:

(a)Strengthen the capacity of National, State and district institutions and
organisations for planning, management and evaluation of girls' education at
the elementary level, and create a dynamic management structure that will be
able to respond to the challenges of girls' education;(b)Develop innovative
gender sensitisation / training programmes, with the assistance of concerned
organisations and women's groups, for teachers and administrators and create
an environment whereby all the sections of the education sector will become
alive and sensitive to the role of education in eliminating gender
disparities;(c)Initiate networking between different institutions for
research, extension and information dissemination to increase output of gender
sensitive, quality teaching- learning material especially in regional
languages, and decentralised area-specific models of intervention;(d)Gear the
entire education system to play a positive interventionist role to enhance
self-esteem and self-confidence of women and girls; build a positive image of
women by recognizing their contribution to the society, polity and the
economy.(e)Break gender stereotypes, ensuring that the content and process of
education is sensitive to gender concerns.(f)Provide co-ordinated efforts, to
ensure necessary support services to enhance girls' participation and
performance in elementary education.(g)Build community support for girls'
education and provide a conducive environment for girls' education in the
school, community and home; and(h)Ensure that girls get good quality education
at the elementary level.

### 5\. Strategy. - A. Mobilisation for girls' education, involving community,
teachers, NGOs, etc. This is to be a process oriented programme, where
community ownership and the basket of components must evolve with local
participation.

B. The block will be the designated as the unit of planning implementation and
monitoring.C. A basket of components has been provided in the scheme. However,
all blocks may not need to take up all activities. The projects should be
based on local conditions and need of that block; all strategies and
interventions must target all girls in the age group of 6 - 14 years for
universal elementary education (UEE) with special focus on girls in difficult
situations, namely:• Out of school girls; including never enrolled and dropout
girls• Overage girls , who have not completed elementary education• Working
girls• Girls from marginalized social groups.• Girls with low attendance•
Girls rescued from work, trafficked children, daughters of sex workers,
displaced girls including girls in disturbed areas and urban settings.D.
Development of guidelines for incorporating gender concerns in curriculum and
pedagogy, development of material including teaching learning material, audio
- visuals and other material helping in enriching curriculum and textbooks,,
development/ of supplementary reading materials for girls, including life
skills, which would provide the support needed for girls' education.E. The
focus of interventions should be on retention of girls and improvement in
quality of learning. Quality of Education to girls implies their improved:•
Participation in schooling for which reduced dropout rates will be necessary
preconditions• Completion rates to render the system efficient• Transition
rates to next level of education• Empowerment of girls through participation
in learner centered and activity based learning to enhance their knowledge,
their self esteem and self-confidence, skills and capacities to equip them for
coping with different situations in life, enable them to make informed
choices, participate in decision making processes, access resources that will
assure them quality of life.Detailed action plans for the target group of
girls and the specific strategies to be adopted in the block need to be spelt
out, with defined and measurable outcomes. The annual work plan and budget
(AWP&B) of districts prepared under SSA, should reflect NPEGEL block- specific
projects accordingly.F. The NPEGEL components should not duplicate any
component already provided in the SSA framework. In case of a special project
being developed for the block, the unit cost of each component would be
finalized by the state level Executive Committee or the State Advisory Council
(SAC) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.

### 6\. Components of NPEGEL:

6.1Block Focus Projects for girls at risk/difficult circumstances. - Detailed
action plans for the target group of girls and specific strategies to be
adopted in the block need to be spelt out, with defined and measurable
outcomes. Annual Work Plan of districts prepared under SSA should reflect
NPEGEL block-specific project. Funds permissible per block would be within the
ceiling of the sum total of the activities admissible per cluster under the
scheme. All clusters in an EBB are eligible for coverage under NPEGEL. For
effective implementation phasing of coverage is suggested.6.2Model Cluster
school (MCS): A Model Cluster School for Girls', as a model girl- child
friendly school at cluster level will be opened in all selected
districts/blocks where the scheme is operational. A cluster will be for about
5-10 villages with each block having about 8-10 clusters. This girl-child
friendly infrastructure will be used by all the schools in that cluster, by
rotation. It shall have facilities in terms of teaching learning equipment,
books, equipment, games, etc. Facilities available, like books will also be
circulated to the schools in the clusters. Facilities will be used for
learning through computers, film shows, reading material, self defence, life
skills, riding bicycles, reading, games etc. Instructors will be hired for the
day or on contract for imparting vocational and other training. These would be
aimed at improving the achievement of girls, fostering an interest in
education among them, and raising the importance of girls' education in the
community. The facilities will also be used for teacher training in the
cluster. Clusters will be taken up in a phased manner, and those schools will
be selected which have shown the best performance for enrolment of girls over
the baseline, and which are accessible to around 10 villages / schools, whose
girls can use this infrastructure and which has land for additional civil
works and play fields. While selecting the location of the model cluster
schools, the density of SC/ ST population would also be taken into
consideration.6.3An existing school will be identified for opening of 'Model
Cluster School for Girls' having the density of SC /ST/OBC/Minority girls. The
cost of additional classroom, if required, for this purpose shall be taken
from SSA civil works and included in the AWP&B.

### 7\. Programmatic Norms. - 7.1 NPEGEL interventions will supplement and
support girls' education over and above the investments for girls' education
through SSA interventions.

7.2All strategies and interventions must target all the 6 - 14 year old girls within the block.7.3Focus of interventions should be on retention of girls and improvement in the quality of learning. Detailed action plans for the target group of girls and the specific strategies to be adopted in the block are spelt out, with defined and measurable outcomes.7.4The activities under the recurring NPEGEL grant would be need based for each block including the following:(a)Recurring grant for Model Cluster Schools in the Block for promotion of girls' education in that cluster, including maintenance of that school/and engagement of part time instructor for additional specified subjects.(b)Awards to schools/teachers for outstanding contribution to enrolment, retention and learning outcomes of girl students(c)Learning Through Open School: The implementing agencies will device suitable system with NIOS, State Open Schools or other such organizations for this purpose. The cluster school will form the venue of the residential upper primary school/NGO centre. This will help to bring girls who had droped out in to the education system. Short term residential courses can also be organized.(d)Child Care Centres: NPEGEL provides for opening of additional Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Centres to meet the gap in the ICDS Scheme, and relieve girls from the burden of sibling care. Two ECCE centres per cluster run by community may be opened in the areas where there is no ICDS centre under any scheme of the Ministry of Women & Child Development and/or the State Government concerned. These funds can also be used for strengthening existing local ICDS centres especially for augmenting training for pre school component, play way kits, joint trainings with primary school teachers and pro-rata payment of honorarium of Anganwari workers due to extension of Anganwari timings to match school timings.(e)Items such as stationery, slates, work books, uniforms, providing escorts in difficult areas, etc7.5Some other indicative activities which could be undertaken 1 within funds allocated above, include:• Learning through computers especially at upper primary level;• Life skill education to enable skills and capacities for coping with I difficult situation in life; enabling them to make informed choices; I participate in decision making processes and access resources 1 that will assure them quality of life.• Educational Tours/Exposure Visits to enhance their knowledge, self esteem and self confidence.• Interaction with important people of the area.• Designing Special Training for older girls and development | of relevant content for residential and non-residential Special Training for older girls, who were drop outs or had never enrolled.• Follow-up strategies for providing ongoing support to girls mainstreamed to schools from bridge courses and special training centres.• Engagement of older women as escorts for school going girls where schools are at a distance or passage to school is hazardous or unsafe.• Monitoring and tracking of girls' attendance and supportive strategies to facilitate regular attendance of girls and their retention in schools to enhance learning achievement, completion and transition to next level of education.7.6While preparing block-specific plans, these activities need to be shown against any of the appropriate activities listed in the norm.(i)Nutrition and School Health: Health remains a critical issue for girls' education. Greater malnutrition among girls and lower family priority towards their health affects their learning capacity. School health would involve general health check up with a more intensive follow up of such girls who require special attention. On sanctioning of a 'Model Cluster School for Girl Child', a list of such schools mentioning the nearest Government Hospital or Referral Hospital or PHC Centre to the school will be provided to the concerned State Health Department under intimation to the Department of Elementary Education & Literacy, who will request the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for providing necessary services to the Model Cluster Schools. A synergy for this would be built with the Department of Health. Similar synergy will be developed for convergence of 'Mid-day Meal Scheme' run by the Department of Elementary Education & Literacy.(ii)Community Mobilization (Mobilization for enrolment, retention and learning):At the District and cluster (a group of about ten villages) level, mobilization activities including the training of teachers and educational administrators, mobilisation of the community, including formation and training of resource groups (Mother Teacher Associations (MTA), Women Motivator Groups(WMG), Mahila Samakhya (MS) Sanghas etc.), activities by resource group like enrolment, retention, talking to parents etc., training & review of resource group, community follow up of enrolment, attendance, achievement etc shall be carried out.The key to girls' education is community mobilisation. The SSA programme already mentions mobilisation at habitation/ village/ urban slum level. For this purpose, a Cluster Coordinator along with a core group at cluster level comprising of women workers, volunteers and mothers/ parents etc. will assist in bringing girls from the villages, as well as monitoring their achievement, attendance, retention etc. Training of the community/ resource groups involving Mother-Teacher Association, Women Management Groups, Sanghas, etc. will also be taken up under this component.At the cluster level there will be a Coordinator (One for every 5-25 villages), who will work as an honorary women worker. She will be paid TA/DA, etc. There will be a core group at the block level, which will be responsible for coordinating with and converging with the DGU and existing programme. This Core Group will play one of the most critical roles in the programme, in terms of planning, mobilisation and implementing the programmes package of activities.

### 8\. Financial Norms. - The AWP&B of districts prepared under SSA should
reflect NPEGEL block-specific projects for girls at risk / difficult
circumstances with clearly defined outcomes subject to the following
conditions:

8.1Non-Recurring Grant(i)A one-time non recurring grant of Rs. 30,000 for
teaching learning equipment, library, sports, vocational training etc. for new
MCS.(ii)Rs. 2.00 lakh would be available as recurring grant for skill building
activities (in lieu of additional classroom) for girls to be utilized upto a
period of 3 years for new MCS.8.2Recurring Grant(i)Funds per block would be
the sum total of the sub-components to .the extent of Rs. 60,000/- per cluster
per annum for recurring grant.(ii)The activities under the recurring grant
would be need based for each block including the following:(a)Recurring grant
to Model Cluster Schools for expenditure on promotion of girls' education in
that cluster, including maintenance of that school, and engagement of part
time instructor for specified subjects, provided that no instructor would be
hired for more than three months in an academic year and he/she would not
receive remuneration exceeding Rs. 1,000/- per months.(b)Awards to schools/
teacher: One award per year @ Rs. 5,000 (in kind) will be provided to a
school/ teacher at cluster level for outstanding contribution to girls
education at elementary level.(c)Learning through open schools: A Maximum or
Rs. 50,000/-per annum will be provided to each cluster towards the payment of
fees and provision of supplementary teaching to be taken of with the help of
National Open School or State Open School.(d)Child Care Centres: Opening of
additional Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Centres: Each centre
opened under .the 'Girl Education Component' of the SSA will have a recurring
grant of Rs. 5000/- and non- recurring grant of Rs. 1000/- per
annum.(e)Additional items: SSA provides for free textbooks to all girl-
children upto a limit of Rs. 150/- per child at primary level and Rs. 250/-
per child at upper primary level. However, if there are any savings after
providing for free text books to the girls, the balance money out of this
amount may be used for providing additional items such as stationery, slates,
work books, etc.(f)Management Cost (including Community Mobilization): In
addition to the provisions already available under SSA, 6Vo of the total
district outlay on NPEGEL would be earmarked towards management
cost.(g)Intensive community mobilization would be undertaken from the funds
available under management cost, for creating an environment supportive of
girls' education, and improving their enrolment, retention and learning
levels.(h)Funds available under management cost could also be used, inter
alia, for activities like MIS and documentation, honorarium and TA/DA to
cluster coordinators, meetings at cluster level, etc.

### 9\. Implementation Authority

9.1State Level Structure. - 9.1.1 The SSA State Implementation Society will be
the implementing agency of the NPEGEL at State level. Therefore, funds for
this programme will be routed through the SSA society of the State. At the
State level a 'Gender Coordinator' will be appointed, who will look after the
NPEGEL. In States where Mahila Samakhya (MS) programme is operational, the SSA
society may give preference to the MS Society for implementing NPEGEL in the
blocks of MS operations provided the MS Society in the State is willing to
undertake the implementation of the programme. In such States, the SSA society
shall transfer the funds to MS Society for implementation of the programme.
The monitoring and evaluation of the component will be done by the State SSA
.Society. In blocks where MS is not being implemented or MS is not willing to
undertake the implementation of the scheme, the implementation of this
component will be through the existing mechanism used for implementation of
SSA.9.1.2State Mahila Samakhya Societies (MSS), wherever set up under the
directions of the Government of India, will provide direction and support to
the programme. The MS society will ensure the representation of SC/ST women's
organisation in the SRG of MSS. In States that do not have an MSS, the SRG for
Gender/girls' education set up under SSA with nominees from relevant
departments of the State Government, Government of India, experts in girls'
education and representatives of SC/ ST women's organisations will function
for the purpose.9.1.3Suitable assistance can be taken from institutions like
Women's studies centres at Universities/colleges, etc. The resource centres
under the Mahila Samakhya programme, at the State level, will be the nodal
institution to coordinate with individuals, Government and other organisations
for the development of material etc.9.2District Structure. - 9.2.1 Activities
would include preparatory activities, including formation of core teams for
girls education, training of core teams, baseline assessments and block and
village mapping, and social assessments, village and block plans preparation
and facilitation. Simultaneously, advocacy and communication activities,
including the formation/ mobilisation of MTAs, PTAs and other core groups in
the village would be included, in addition to implementation of the block
plans.9.2.2Gender Unit of SSA in collaboration with MS (wherever, MS is
undertaking NPEGEL), will administer the NPEGEL at district level. A 'District
Gender Co-ordinator' shall be appointed for each district. The District Gender
Unit will consist of District Gender coordinator, Resource persons and
supporting staff. This unit will co-ordinate and supervise all aspect of the
component at district level, and provide resource and training support. It
will also network with the local administration, other institutions and NGOs
in the district.9.3Sub-District Unit. - 9.3.1 At the block level, the
coordinator, will, with the help of the national, State and district level,
coordinate the training of teachers and educational administrators,
mobilisation of the community, regular monitoring of girls' enrolment,
retention, and achievement, and work with communities to devise
strategies.9.3.2. There will be a core group at the block level, which will be
responsible for coordinating with and converging with the DGU and existing
programmes. Selection of core groups would be done at two
levels:(i)Coordinator : 1 (to be selected from among the teachers)(ii)Resource
person : 1 (to be selected from among the teachers)(iii)Other members of
resource support group at field level. These community level activists for
community mobilisation, local level monitoring, and on site resource support
would be selected from among youth groups and women students.9.3.3The core
group will, with the help of students, teachers and volunteers, do surveys,
and help prepare the village plans. They will also monitor and oversee the
implementation of these plans. The core groups will form the major vehicle for
community mobilisation, monitoring in the village the progress for enrolment,
drop out, achievement of girls, facilitating with the VEC/ MTA/ village
community in devising interventions for these activities in the village, and
creating an environment for girls' education. They will be selected on the
basis of their aptitude.9.3.4At the cluster level there will be Co-ordinators
(One for every 5 -25 villages), who will work as honorary women workers and
will have the assistance of a Core Group. The Cluster Coordinator will be paid
TA/DA, etc. The Core Group will be responsible for coordinating with and
converging with the District Gender Unit and existing programme. This Core
Group will play one of the most critical roles in the programme, in terms of
planning, mobilisation and implementing the programmes package of
activities.In older MS areas, the federations or the Sanghas could takeover
this role. In all project areas, efforts will be made to eventually hand over
this function to such groups of activists. The coordinator would work along
side the Model cluster school. At the cluster level, the coordinator, will,
coordinate the mobilisation of the community, regular monitoring of girls'
enrolment, retention, and achievement, and work with the core group and
communities to devise strategies to achieve project goals.9.3.5The village
level efforts will be co-ordinated by Mahila Samakhya Sanghas, core groups,
VECs, Mothers Committees or Parent Teacher Associations, as the case may be.
The district unit, cluster coordinators and village Sanghas will respectively,
decide the prioritisation for activities and incentives to be taken up in the
cluster/ village. This autonomy is vital for genuine local needs/solutions to
get reflected in the programme activities/strategies.9.3.6A Cluster Level
Committee would be formed for monitoring the cluster level activities and
would consist of the Presidents of SMC of the schools located in the villages
in the cluster. The President of the Cluster level Committee would be selected
from its members by rotation every quarter. The Head Master of the 'Model
Cluster School for Girls' would be the member-secretary. If number of women
member is less than four, an additional member may be co-opted from the SMC to
ensure that at least 4 women members are there.9.4National Support Group. -

structures, accordingly.Annexure-6Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya

### 1\. Background

1.1The Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) scheme was launched by the
Government of India in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at
upper primary level for girls belonging predominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and
minorities in difficult areas. Initially it ran as a separate scheme, but was
merged with the SSA programme with effect from 1st April, 2007. With the RTE
Act, 2009 coming into force with effect from 1st April 2010, and the SSA
Framework of Implementation being revised to correspond to the RTE Act, the
KGBV component of SSA would also be implemented in the overall context of
child rights and child entitlements and in harmony with the spirit and
stipulations of the Act.

### 2\. Scope/ Coverage of the scheme

2.1KGBVs can be opened in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs), previously,
defined on a composite criteria of blocks with a rural female literacy rate
below the national average (46.13%: Census 2001) and gender gap in literacy
higher than the national average (21.59%: Census 2001). Within these blocks,
priority was given to areas with:• Concentration of tribal population, and/or
a large number of girls out of school;• Concentration of SC, ST, OBC and
minority populations, and/or a large number of girls out of school;• Areas
with low female literacy; or• Areas with a large number of small, scattered
habitations that do not qualify for a school2.2The criteria of eligible blocks
was revised with effect from 1st April, 2008 to include the following:• EBBs
with rural female literacy below 30%; and• Towns/cities having minority
concentration (as per the list identified by Ministry of Minority Affairs)
with female literacy rate below the national average (53.67%: Census
2001).2.3In 2010-11 opening of KGBVs has been extended to all EBBs with rural
female literacy below the national average as per Census 2001.

### 3\. Objective

3.1The objective of KGBV is to ensure access and quality education to girls
from disadvantaged groups by setting up residential schools at upper primary
level.

### 4\. Strategies

4.1Initially, KGBVs shall be opened in rented or other available Government
buildings. Once land has been identified, suitable buildings shall be
constructed. The unit cost of new KGBVs hostel buildings has been revised
since October 2010 to conform to the State PWD Schedule of Rates (SOR). The
minimum area for KGBV hostel buildings shall be calculated based on basic
amenities and requirements as indicated below:• For 50 children the carpet
area of the building would be approximately 80 sq.ft/ child• For 100 children
the carpet area of the building would be approximately 60 sq.ft/ child4.2Such
residential schools will be setup only in those EBBs that do not have
residential schools at upper primary level for girls under any other scheme of
Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment and Ministry of Tribal Affairs. This
shall be ensured by the district level authority of SSA at the time of actual
district level planning of KGBV initiatives by co-ordinating with the other
Departments/Ministries.

### 5\. The components of the scheme will be as follows:

(i)Setting up of residential schools where there are a minimum of 50 girls
predominantly from the SC, ST and minority communities available to study in
the school at the elementary level. The number can be more than 50 depending
on the number of eligible girls. Three possible models for such school have
been identified and revised financial norms for the same are:Model I: Schools
with hostels for 100 girls Recurring cost: Rs. 32.07 lakh Recurring cost for
in take of additional girls: To be worked out proportionately based on the
number of intake of additional girls.a. In case the enrollment exceeds 100
children, a head teacher as per RTE norms will be provided with unit cost of
Rs. 20000/- per month.b. An additional teacher with a salary of Rs. 15000/-
per month will be provided when enrollment exceeds 105 children based on 1:35
ratio as per RTE Act.c. An additional assistant cook with a salary of Rs.

above 50 girls but up to 100 girls for providing part time teachers, Assistant
cook etc.Note: Replacement of bedding (Once in three years @ Rs. 750/-per
child)• The intake of girls could be increased from the existing level of 50
to 100 in blocks with a high number of out of school / dropout girls for which
the recurring & non-recurring grants will be increased commensurate to
additional enrollment of girls.• Item-wise details are given in Appendix A, B
& C.(ii)To provide necessary infrastructure for these schools(iii)To prepare
and procure necessary teaching learning material and aids for the
schools(iv)To put in place appropriate systems to provide necessary academic
support and for evaluation and monitoring(v)To motivate and prepare the girls
and their families to send them to residential school(vi)At the primary level
the emphasis will be on the slightly older girls who are out of school and
were unable to complete primary schools (10+). However, in difficult areas
(migratory populations, scattered habitations that do not qualify for primary/
upper primary schools) younger girls can also be targeted(vii)At the upper
primary level, emphasis will be on girls, especially, adolescent girls who are
unable to go to regular schools(viii)In view of the targeted nature of the
scheme, 75% girls from SC, ST, OBC or minority communities would be accorded
priority for enrolment in such residential schools and only thereafter, 25%
girls from families below poverty line.(ix)Established NGOs and other non-
profit making bodies will be involved in the running of the schools, wherever
possible. These residential schools can also be adopted by the corporate
groups.

### 6\. Implementation, monitoring and evaluation

6.1The SSA State Implementation Society will be the implementing agency of the
KGBV at State level. Therefore, funds for this programme will be routed
through the SSA society of the State. At the State level, a 'Gender
Coordinator' will be appointed who will look after the KGBV. In States where
Mahila Samakhya (MS) programme is operational, the SSA society may give
preference to the MS Society for implementing KGBV in the blocks of MS
operations provided that the MS Society in the state is willing to imdertake
the implementation of the programme. In such States, the SSA society shall
transfer the approved funds to MS Society for implementation of the programme.
The monitoring and evaluation of the component will be done by the State SSA
Society. In blocks where MS or in blocks where MS has not given its
concurrence to implement KGBV the implementation of this component will be
through the SSA.6.2Training for teachers and staff at the residential schools
will be coordinated by the District Institutes of Educational Training, Block
Resource Centres and the Mahila Samakhya Resource Groups.

### 7\. State Support Group

7.1An Advisory State level coordination committee/SRG as approved under the
NPEGEL scheme shall provide direction and support to the programme. This group
will consist of nominees from relevant State Government Departments,
Government of India, experts in the field of girls education, educationists
etc. The selection of an appropriate model of the school and its location
would be done by this Committee based on the recommendation of the district
committee implementing the NPEGEL and the new proposed scheme district level
implementing agency for KGBV

### 8\. National Support Group

8.1The National Resource Group (NRG) created under the Mahila Samakhya
programme at the National level shall provide inputs on conceptual issues and
concerns arising in the programme, and advice GOI on policy matters concerning
the education of girls. This group will provide the interface with research
and training institutions, women's movement, educationists and non-
Governmental institutions and also bring in other experiences of educating
girls.8.2Since the NRG, consists of a small number of persons and meets only
two to three times in a year, smaller sub committees of the NRG created for
specific inputs, like gender training of teachers, development of gender based
teaching learning material, development of audio visual programmes etc. will
co- opt additional persons from relevant institutions or experts for the
purpose.

### 9\. Methodology

9.1Based on the number of girls and the type of residential school to be
provided, the selection of the model of the school to be selected would be
done by a State Level Committee based on the recommendation of the District
Committee for the purpose. The proposal shall be forwarded to the Cell at the
National level who shall appraise them with the help of external
agencies/consultants, where necessary. Finally, the Project Approval Board of
SSA will approve these plans.

### 10\. Funding Pattern or release of funds

10.1The funding pattern of the Central Government and States/UTs for the KGBV
scheme will be the same as per the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, as it is a component
of SSA with effect from 1st April, 2007.10.2The provisions for KGBV will be in
addition to the provisions already made under other components of SSA and for
NPEGEL. The SSA Society shall ensure convergence of KGBV with NPEGEL and
Mahila Samakhya programme. It shall also ensure that funds allocated are
appropriately utilized and there is no duplication of activities.10.3The
Government of India would directly release funds to the SSA State
Implementation Society. The State Government will also release its share to
the State Implementation Society. Funds will be released thereafter to the
Mahila Samakhya Society wherever applicable. In States where MS is not being
implemented, the implementation will be through the SSA Society10.4The State
Society should open a separate Savings Bank Account for operating the funds of
KGBV. State Government should also release its matching share to the State SSA
Society through a separate budget head. Separate accounts will have to be
maintained at district and sub-district structures,
accordingly.Annexure-7Central Sponsored Scheme For Providing Quality Education
In Madarasa (Spqem)Introduction:National Policy on Education (NPE) has adopted
the concept of national system of education, implying that up to a certain
level allstudents irrespective of caste, creed, language or sex have access to
education of comparable quality. The Policy lays special emphasis on removal
of disparities and equalizing educational opportimities by attending to the
specific needs of those who have remained educationally backward so far.
Suitable incentives therefore, have to be provided to educationally backward
sections of the society.

### 2\. The National Policy on Education commits itself to provide all
possible means for the uplift of the educationally backward minorities. The
children of the educationally backward muslim minorities attend
Maktabs/Madrassas/Darul-Ulooms with very little participation in the national
mainstream education system. These institutions provide by and large,
religious teaching. In order to provide them with access to education in
modern subjects, the Central Government has been implementing the Area
intensive and Madrassa Modernisation Scheme. The scheme as implemented during
the X Plan had two components, namely infrastructure support for educational
institutions catering to educationally backward population and introduction of
modem subjects in traditional institutions of Madrassas.

### 3\. The National Monitoring Committee for Minorities Education (NMCME) was
constituted in 2004 to look into all aspects of education of minorities and
suggest ways and means to improve the conditions for educational empowerment
of minorities and visited several states and interacted with the leaders of
the Muslim minority community, educationists and Madrassa Managements. An
Expert Committee of the NMCME was constituted to give inputs for revising the
programme of modernization of Madrassas and submitted its report. The Expert
Committee has suggested that madrassas be provided a linkage with the National
Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) to provide for certification of academic
levels, linkages with vocational education, improving the quality of education
in modern subjects, introduced teacher training, enhancement of teacher
salaries, strengthening of State Madrassa Boards for monitoring and raising
awareness about education programmes for the Muslim community.

### 4\. The scheme for providing quality education in Madrassas has been
recast after taking into account the inputs of the Expert Committee of NMCME.

Budget Provisions:

### 5\. An amount of Rs. 325 crore is proposed for the scheme as per budget
provision made by Planning Commission in the Xlth Five Year Plan.

Objectives:

### 6\.

(i)The objective of the Scheme is to encourage traditional institutions like
Madrassas and Maktabs by giving financial assistance to introduce science,
mathematics, social studies, Hindi and English in their curriculum so that
academic proficiency for classes I-XII is attainable for children studying in
these institutions. However, the process of modernization of traditional
Madrassas and Maktabs will be voluntary.(ii)The scheme will provide
opportunities to students of these institutions to acquire education
comparable to the National Education System especially for secondary and
senior secondary levels. This will enable children studying in these
institutions to progress to higher levels of learning and also open up better
job opportunities for them. Maktaba/Madrassas/Dar-ul-Ulooms can opt to become
accredited study centres with the National Institutions of Open Schooling
(NIOS) for prim i , and middle levels of education or/and for secondary and
senior secondary levels as well. Assistance would be given to Maktabs,
Madrassas and Dar-ul-Uloom for activities, which contribute to these
objectives.(iii)The scheme also will seek to provide opportunities for
vocational training for children studying in Madrassas opting for assistance
above 14 years of age, to enhance their opportunities for entering the job
market and encourage entrepreneurship.(iv)The scheme will also strengthen
State Madrassa Boards opting for assistance, by enabling them to monitor the
madrassa modernization programme and enhance awareness about education among
the muslim community.(v)The scheme will address in-service training of
teachers appointed under the scheme, for teaching modem subjects of science,
mathematics, social studies, Hindi and English, to improve their pedagogical
skills.Coverage:

India Ministry of Human Resource Development Department of School Education &
LiteracyNew Delhi, dated the 16th February, 2009ToAll State/UT Secretaries
dealing with Madrassa Modernization Scheme Subject: Clarifications on the
revamped central sponsored Scheme for Providing Quality Education in
Madrassas(SPQEM).Sir/Madam,Following queries which have come to the notice of
this Department from various quarters related to implementing the revised
scheme of Providing Quality Education in Madrassas (SPQEM); the Department of
School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development seeks to
clarify the position as follows:-

### 1\. All Madrassas teachers receiving honorarium under the erstwhile scheme
of Madrassa Modernization will continue to be provided the same under the
SPQEM Scheme in the Xlth Plan, albeit teachers without requisite
qualifications prescribed in the revised scheme of SPQEM, will receive
honorarium at pre-revised rates. Period of two years will be given to such
teachers to acquire the qualifications as prescribed under the SPQEM Scheme.
Other financial and eligibility conditions under the revised scheme will
continue to apply.

### 2\. A maximum of three full time graduate or post-graduate with B.Ed.
teachers would be paid honorarium subject to availability of students in each
of the modern subjects taught, in a Maktab/Madrassa. If Maktabs or Madrassas
are registered as separate entities, they can apply as different entities
under the scheme of SPQEM.

### 3\. Financial assistance under the SPQEM towards honorarium of teachers
teaching modem subjects as laid down in para 8(a) of the scheme, be treated as
maximum ceilings for teachers' honorarium levels. Madrassas/States desirous of
paying lower emoluments or creating more than two categories could do so with
full justification indicated while filling up the application forms.

### 4\. It is clarified that accreditation of Madrassas/Maktabs with National
Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) is optional, madrassas not seeking academic
or vocational accreditation need not fill Format III and 8(iv) of Part-I of
the Application Form of Format IV & 8(v) of part I of the application form, as
the case may be.

Madrassas (SPQEM).(i)Madrassa teachers receiving honorarium under the
erstwhile Area Intensive Madrassa Modernization Programme would continue to be
eligible under the revised scheme of SPQEM for the duration of the 11th Plan
period. If the existing Madrassa teachers do not have the educational
qualifications prescribed under the revised scheme, they would receive
honorarium at the pre-revised rates. However, if they already do have the
requisite qualifications, they would be entitled to honoraria at the revised
rates.(ii)Clarifications had been issued vide our letter of even number dated
16th February, 2009 regarding teachers qualifications that teachers who do not
have the requisite qualification would be required to acquire the
qualifications within a period of two years. The time frame for teachers to

years.(iii)As regards the number to teachers for whom financial assistance is
available under the SPQEM, it was clarified that a maximum of three full time
graduate or post graduate with B.Ed teachers of modern subjects would be
provided depending on the availability of students in the Madrassas/Maktabs.
If Maktabs or Madrassas are registered as separate entities, they can apply as
separate entities under the SPQEM.(iv)All State Governments are also requested
to ensure better transparency and accountability by depositing teachers'
salaries in their respective bank accounts.Yours faithfully, Sd/-(S.S.

### 1\. Scheme For Infrastructure Development Private Aided/unaided Minority
Institutes (Elementary Secondary/senior Secondary Schools) (IDMI)

Introduction:National Policy on Education (NPE) has adopted the concept of a
national system of education, implying that all students irrespective of
caste, creed, language or sex have access to education of comparable quality.
The Policy lays special emphasis on removal of disparities and equalizing
educational opportunities by attending to the specific needs of those who have
remained educationally backward so far.

### 2\. In pursuance of NPE stipulations, the scheme of Area Intensive
Development for ensuring an area intensive approach to education was launched
in the IXth Plain. This scheme was merged with Madrassas Modernisation Scheme
during the Xth Plan with two components of Modernisation and Infrastructure
remaining separate. No financial assistance for infrastructure development was
envisaged for madrassas to whom assistance was restricted to providing
honorarium for the teachers teaching modern subjects and assistance under the
infrastructure component was provided to Governmental and Non Governmental
educational institutions imparting modern education.

### 3\. Two components of infrastructure and modernization are sought to be
demerged in the Xlth Plan in view of the fact that the target groups for these
two components are different. The component of Modernization of Madrassas has
been recast and a separate scheme of providing quality education in madrassas
drawn up. The infrastructure component is proposed to be incorporated in this
scheme - Infrastructure Development of private aided/unaided Minority
Institutes (IDMI) (elementary secondary/senior secondary schools).

Objective:

### 4\. The scheme would facilitate education of minorities by augmenting and
strengthening school infrastructure in Minority Institutions
(elementary/secondary/senior secondary schools) in order to expand facilities
for formal education to children of minority communities. The scheme will
inter alia encourage educational facilities for girls, children with special
needs and those who are most deprived educationally amongst minorities.

Coverage:

### 5\. The scheme will cover the entire country. However, preference will be
given to eligible minority institutions (private aided/unaided
elementary/secondary/senior secondary schools) located in districts, blocks
and towns having a minority population above 20% based on available census
data.

Financial Pattern:

### 6\. An amount of Rs.125 crore is proposed for the scheme in the Xlth Five
Year Plan.

### 7\. The scheme will fund infrastructure development of private aided/
unaided minority elementary/secondary/senior secondary schools to the extent
of 75% and subject to a maximum of Rs. 50 lakhs per school for:

(i)Strengthening of educational infrastructure and physical facilities in the
existing elementary/secondary/senior secondary school including additional
classrooms, science/computer lab rooms, library rooms, toilets, drinking water
facilities etc.(ii)Hostel building for children in such category of schools,
specially for girls.(iii)Any other educational infrastructure not covered in
(i) or (ii) above, but which in view of the State/Central Grant in Aid
Committee is justified for educational advancement of the minority
institution.Eligibility Conditions:

### 8\. Voluntary organizations/societies/ trusts running institutes/schools
that are recognized by Central or State Governments shall be eligible to apply
for assistance under the scheme.

### 9\. Only those voluntary agencies, which have been in existence for a
minimum of three years, would be considered for assistance under this scheme.

### 10\. Voluntary organizations eligible under the scheme should:

• have a proper constitution or Articles of Association;• have a properly
constituted managing body with its powers and duties clearly defined in the
constitution• be in a position to secure the involvement, on voluntary basis,
of knowledgeable persons for furtherance of their programmes; not be run for
the profit of anv individual or a body of individuals;• not discriminate
against any person or group of persons on the ground of language or sex etc;•
not function for the furtherance of the interests of any political party; nor
in any manner incite communal disharmony.

### 11\. The institute/school for which assistance is being sought should have
been functioning for at least 3 years and have substantial enrolment of
children from the minority communities. The institution/school not be a
commercialized school charging high fees.

### 12\. The application of the voluntary organization will be addressed to
the concerned Secretary of the State/UT, who will be the Chairperson of Grant-
in-Aid committee in the State/UT.

Implementation And Monitoring:

### 13\. The scheme will be implemented through the State Government. All
requests for financial assistance entertained by the State Government in the
prescribed application form appended at Annexure will be considered on merit
first by the State level Grant-In-Aid committee. The State Government will
draw up and notify criteria for prioritization of applications under this
scheme and give it wide publicity. The criterion should consider the specific
status of minorities in that State/UT and give priority to (i) direct
educational infrastructure requirements by which enrolment and retention of
minority children in the school/institution is likely to increase, (ii)
encourage education of girls, children with special needs and children from
the more educationally backward minorities in the State, (iii) the State level
Grant-in-Aid Committee will recommend cases of voluntary organizations and the
specific schools/institutions to be assisted, to Central Government in order
of priority. A lower priority should be accorded institutions/Schools/minority
organizations that have already received funds under the erstwhile scheme of
AIMMP, during the 10th Plan.

### 14\. On receipt of proposals from the State Governments the GIAC of the
Centra] Government, will consider them on merit and recommend assistance.

### 15\. A Grants-in-Aid Committee (GIAC) under the Chairmanship of Union
Secretary, School Education & Literacy would be constituted for the purpose,
with Joint Secretary concerned as Member-Secretary and EA (HRD) as member. It
shall have representatives from Ministry of Minority Affairs and State
Government concerned. The Ministry of HRD will nominate two eminent
educationists from amongst Minorities to the GIAC. The GIAC will examine and
approve the proposals of the State and UT Governments.

### 16\. The financial assistance will be provided on a one time basis. A
voluntary organization or educational institution can receive benefit from the
scheme only once in five years. Funds will be released in two installments by
GOI through the State Government. The second installment will need to be
claimed within one year of the first installment during which period the 25%
share of the minority institution, should have been contributed to the
infrastructure upgradation.

### 17\. Voluntary Agencies receiving the assistance would be required to
furnish audited details of expenditure made in the prescribed proforma duly
attested by a chartered accountant/the competent authority.

### 18\. The grant will be admissible to only those organizations/institutions
which submit the updated statement of accounts for all the grant-in-aid
received by them under this scheme in the past, duly certified by a chartered
accountant.

### 19\. Monitoring reports regarding the voluntary organizations receiving
assistance will indicate, total number of beneficiary students, amount
received and utilized by the institutions, shall be furnished to the Ministry
of Human Resource Development Government of India on an annual basis by the
State Government, after obtaining the same from voluntary organizations
receiving assistance under the scheme.

### 20\. The accounts/records of activities of the voluntary organization
shall be available on demand for inspection to Central/State Government/ C&AG.

### 21\. The Central & State Governments will widely publicize the scheme.

### 22. The performance of the scheme will be evaluated by the Central & State
Governments as appropriate but definitely once after completion of two years
of its operation.

### 23. No claim will be entertained from any organizations/individual for
consideration as a permanent beneficiary since the scheme is to be implemented
on purely voluntary basis envisaging onetime non-recurring financial
assistance.

Annexure 14Scheme for Assistance for Experimental and Innovative Component of
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan/RTE at The Elementary Level.(Revised-January 2011)The
background: The National Policy on Education (NPE) was approved by Parliament
in May, 1986. Programme of Action (POA) for its implementation was approved in
1992. These documents spell out the immediate, medium-term as well as long-
term goals of educational development, and also the strategies to be adopted
for the achievements of these goals.

### 2\. NPE aims at Universalisation of Elementary Education (UEE) by 1995,
the targets by 1990 being confined to provision of five years of education to
all children through formal schooling or the non-formal stream. The strategy
for implementation of UEE has three inter-related components: (i) adoption of
child-centred and activity-based learning system; (ii) a thorough reform of
the content and process of education, including emphasis on values referred to
in para 3.4 of NPE; and (iii) a large and systematic programme of non-formal
education for children of habitations without schools, working children and
girls who cannot attend whole-day schools. While POA sets out some of the
aspects of the action plan; it makes it clear that a variety of experimental
and innovative programmes will be taken up to explore, further parameters and
techniques suited in the various situations and contexts. Creation of
mechanisms for supporting experimentation and innovation, particularly for
UEE, is implicit in NPE and POA.

### 3\. Objectives: The overall aim of this scheme is to promote
experimentation and innovation for the achievement of goals spelt out in NPE
for UEE. Within this overall aim, the specific objectives of the scheme are as
follows:

(a)To identify agencies which can take up experimental and/or innovative
programmes in furtherance of the goals set out in NPE/POA;(b)To provide
financial and administrative support to the selected agencies for the
