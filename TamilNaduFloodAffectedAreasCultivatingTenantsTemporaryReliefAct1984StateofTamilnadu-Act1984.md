1984(Tamil Nadu Act 32 of 1984)Statement of Objects and Reasons. - There had
been failure of monsoon in the years 1981-82 and 1982-83 in this State and the
cultivating tenants were not, in position to pay the rent for the fasli year
ending with the 30th June 1983 and for any previous fasli year. It was,
therefore, considers necessary to give protection to such defaulting tenants
from eviction on ground of default in payment of the said rent till the 15th
January 1984. Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Cultivating Tenants (Protection from
Eviction) Act, 1983 (Tamil Nadu Act 26 of 1983) was enacted.2\. Due to

fasli year ending with the 30th June 1983 and for any previous fasli year and
also for the current fasli year ending with the 30th June 1984. As there would
be spare of petitions before the Courts for realisation of arrears of rent
after the 15th January 1984, it will not be possible for the cultivating
tenants in the flood affected areas to pay all the past arrears of rent at
once. It is, therefore, considered necessary that such defaulting tenants in
the flood affected areas are protected till the 15th January 1985 from
eviction on the ground of default in payment of the said rent.3\. It is also
proposed to restore possession of lands to such tenants who have been evicted
on or after the 15th January 1984 and before the date of the publication of
