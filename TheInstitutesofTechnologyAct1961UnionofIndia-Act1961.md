### 1332.

In order to provide facilities on an extensive scale for post-graduate
courses, advanced work and research in the various branches of science,
engineering and technology, for which facilities in the country were
inadequate, the Sarkar Committee recommended in 1945 that four institutions on
the lines of the famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.A., he
established, one in each of the four regions of the country. Government
accepted this recommendation and the first institution named as the Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagpur started in 1950 in the eastern region as a
Government institution. Although situated in the cast, it has functioned as an
All India Institution in consonance with the original decision that these
institutions should be open to students from all parts of the country. Later,
the Institute at Kharagpur was declared by Parliament as an institution of
national importance under the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act,
1956. The Act came into force on the 1st April, 1957 and the Institute has
been since functioning as an autonomous body corporate.2\. The three other
institutions named as the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, the Indian
Institute of Technology, Madras, and the Indian Institute of Technology,
Kanpur, were started in 1958, 1959 and 1960, respectively, and were registered
under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. All the tour institutions provide
first degree courses in addition to facilities for post-graduate studies and
advanced research. This requires and provides co-operation between work at the
post-graduate level and the first degree level for the mutual benefit of both
and also results in full utilization of the facilities created in these
institutions. They aim at training personnel who will combine the highest
technical competence with broad human sympathy as well as a practical outlook
and awareness of the social implications of planning. The institutes have
already succeeded in creating an atmosphere which instills in the minds of
students a spirit of objective enquiry and a sense of purpose and are helping
them develop a balanced and integrated personality.3\. One of the important
tasks of the institutions is to meet the present and future needs of industry
and technology. They, therefore, have an individuality and purpose of their
own distinct from those of a University. The broad objectives of the four
Institutes are the same, although in their actual working, there will be
difference of emphasis on separate fields, particularly at the advanced
levels. The Bill seeks (i) to retain the individuality of the institutions by
declaring them institutions of national importance tinder Article 248 read
with 7th Schedule, List I, Entry 64 of the Constitution, (ii) to bring in the
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, which has already been so declared
and incorporated by an Act of Parliament, within the ambit of the proposed
Act, and (iii) to make provision lot the co-ordination and regulation of the
affairs of the four Institutes. The Institutes will have the power to grant
degrees. diplomas and other academic distinctions as at present possessed by
the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur".- Gazette of India, 1961,
