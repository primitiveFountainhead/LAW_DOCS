**_Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Eighty-first
Amendment) Bill, 1994 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventy-eighth
Amendment) Act, 1995_****STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS** Article 31B of the
Constitution confers on the enactments included in the Ninth Schedule to the
Constitution immunity from legal challenge on the ground that they violate the
fundamental right enshrined in Part III of the Constitution. The Schedule
consists of list of laws enacted by various State Governments and Central
Government which inter alia affect rights and interest in property including
land.

### 2. In the past, whenever it was found that progressive legislation
conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation, recourse
was taken to the Ninth Schedule. Accordingly, several State enactments
relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have
already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Since the Government is committed
to give importance to land reforms, it has been certain decided to include
land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule so that they are not challenged before
the Courts. The State Governments of Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa,
Rajasthan; Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have suggested the inclusion of some of
their Acts relating to land reforms in the Ninth Schedule.

### 3. Since the amendment to Acts which are already placed in the Ninth
Schedule are not automatically immunised from legal challenge, a number of
amending Acts along with a few principal Acts are also proposed to be included
in the Ninth Schedule so as to ensure that implementation of these Acts is not
adversely, affected by litigation.

[The Constitution (Seventy-eighth Amendment) Act, 1995, is legislation aimed
at amending the incorporation of land reform laws in states like Bihar,
Orissa, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Kerala in the ninth schedule
of the Constitution of India. This amendment gives immunity to legal
challenges being faced in the court of law, meaning that laws present in the
9th schedule of the Indian Constitution cannot be challenged in court. The
Constitution (1st Amendment) Act of 1951 added 13 statutes that could not be
challenged in court even if they violated individuals' basic rights. Later
revisions added 284 laws to the Indian Constitution's ninth schedule, which
cannot be contested.Also Refer]
