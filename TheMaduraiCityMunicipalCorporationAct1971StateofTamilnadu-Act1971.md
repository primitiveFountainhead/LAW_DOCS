The Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1971Tamil Nadu Act 15 of
1971Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act,
1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 15 of 1971). - The question of constituting a municipal
corporation for Madurai City has been under consideration of the Government
for the last two decades. Apart from the historical, pilgrim, and tourist
point of view, where the city has to manage a mammoth floating population of
over 4 lakhs of people during certain periods of the year, it has
significantly developed industrially and therefore civic amenities of a high
order are the legitimate expectation of the people of this City. This City on
all counts has reached the statute of a corporation and is ripe to be upgraded
as such. The constitution of a corporation for the City of Madurai is felt to
be an utmost necessity for the City of Madurai. Moreover, the Government
strongly feel that they should add luster to the great city of Madurai with
its hoary past, where the Tamil Sangam flourished and whose glory has been
sung by the Tamil poets and WEstern historians, by constituting a municipal
corporation for Madurai with effect from the 1st May 1971, and by undertaking
suitable legislation for the purpose.2\. The Madurai Municipality was being
governed by the provisions of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920
(Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920). For the administration of the municipal
corporation of Madurai, a new and separate enactment in lieu of the Tamil Nadu
District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu Act V of 1920) was felt
necessary. Hence it was proposed to undertake legislation on the lines of the
Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu Act IV of 1919), with
such modification as are necessary to suit the local conditions. In view of
the announcement made by the Chief Minister on the floor of the House that the
Madurai municipal corporation would come into being with effect on and from
the 1st May 1971 and in view of the urgent necessity for the constitution of
such corporation as the Madurai City has almost in all respects reached the
stature of a corporation, the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Ordinance,
1971 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 5 of 1971) was promulgated by the Governor, on the
27th April 1971.3\. The Bill seeks to replace the above Ordinance.4\. The
provisions of the Bill are explained in the Notes on Clauses.Published in Part
IV-Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, No. 274,
dated the 24th June, 1971 at page 451.Statement of Objects and Reasons -
Madurai City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1972 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of
1972). - Under the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu
Act 15 of 1971), the Madurai Municipality was constituted as a Municipal
Corporation with effect from the 1st May 1971. By virtue of the provisions
contained in rule 4 of Schedule VII to the said Act, the then members of the
Municipal Council of Madurai who were holding office as such on the said date
were deemed to be members of the Municipal Corporation for the remainder of
the term, i.e., up to the noon of the 28th April 1972. As per the provisions
of rule 7 read with rule 4 of Schedule VII to the said Act, the chairman and
the vice-chairman of the then Madurai Municipal Council holding office as such
on the 1st May 1971 were also allowed to continue as Mayor and Deputy Mayor
respectively of the Corporation of Madurai up to the noon of 28th April 1972.
The term of office of the councillors of the Municipal Corporation of Madurai
was extended up to the 1st May 1974 by the Madurai City Municipal Corporation
(Amendment and Extension of Term of Office) Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 1 of
1972). It had been decided by the Government that during the period of
statutory extension of the term of the councillors of the) Municipal
Corporation of Madurai, there must be yearly election of the Mayor and the
Deputy Mayor and that such election should take place on a date notified by
the Government. A doubt had arisen as to whether the term of the existing
Mayor and the Deputy Mayor had come to an end on the 28th April 1972 though
the term, of the councillors of the Municipal Corporation of Madurai has been
extended up to 1st May 1974 by section 5 of Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 1972,
Therefore, it was also decided to amend rule 7 of Schedule VII of the Tamil
Nadu Act 15 of 1971 so that, the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor referred to in
rule 7 would continue 1 to hold office up to the date of the yearly election
in 1972 under section 29-A of the said Act. To give effect to the above
decisions, the Madurai City Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Ordinance, 1972
(Tamil Nadu Ordinance 1 of 1972), was promulgated by the Governor.2\. The Bill
seeks to replace the above Ordinance.Published in Part IV-Section 4 of the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 13th September
1972.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madurai City Municipal Corporation
(Amendment) Act, 1972. - The Tamil Nadu Additional Assessment and Additional
Water-Cess Act, 1963 (Tamil Nadu Act 8 of 1963), provides for the levy of
additional assessment and additional water-cess on certain lands. The Act does
not, however, provide for the levy of additional, assessment for the assessed
waste wet lands and additional water-cess for the poramboke lands, assessed
waste land (dry or manavari) and unassessed waste lands. It has been
considered that it will be, anomalous to leave off the lands referred to above
from the scope of the Act while the owners of the wet lands and irrigated dry
lands pay additional assessment and additional water-cess respectively under
the provisions of the Act. It has been decided to amend the Act so as to bring
the above clauses of lands within the scope of the Act.2\. In section 2(11) of
the Act the terms "wet land", "single crop wet land", "compounded double-crop
wet land", or "double-crop-wet land" have been defined as the lands registered
in the revenue accounts of the Government as wet, single-crop wet, compounded-
crop wet, or double-crop wet as the case may be. Assessed waste wet lands do
not fall within the scope of the section. It is, therefore, proposed to amend
this section so as to treat the assessed waste wet lands as single-crop wet
lands or double-crop wet lands for the purpose of levy of additional
assessment under sections 3 and 4 of the Act.3\. Section 5 of the Act provides
for the levy of additional water-cess on the lands registered as dry or
manavari in the Revenue accounts of the Government that is, the water-cess
will be increased by 75 per cent in the case of lands under first or second
class source of irrigation and 37'/2 per cent, under third, fourth or fifth
class source of irrigation. It has been decided to treat all poramboke lands,
assessed waste lands (dry or manavari) or unassessed waste lands as one class
of lands and bring them within the scope of this section for purpose of levy
of additional water-cess on these lands. Section 5(1) of the Act, also
provides that the aggregate of land revenue, water-cess and additional water-
cess should not exceed Rs. 15 per acre per ; fasli year for the lands raised
with only one crop and for the first crop if more than one crop) is raised. It
has been considered that no maximum limit need be fixed for the poramboke
lands, assessed waste lands (dry or manavari) and unassessed waste lands, in
view of the fact that these lands are under encroachment and for this purpose
it has been decided to exclude these lands from the provisions under sub-
section (1) of section 5 of the Act so that the main provision in this sub-
section will ipso-facto operate in these cases.4\. The Bill seeks to give
effect to the above objects.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Tamil Nadu
Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2000. - In the year 1998, the Government
repealed the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Hoardings Act, 1985 which provided for
acquisition of hoardings by the Government in the urban local bodies, and made
provisions in the existing Municipal and Corporation Acts to regulate the
erection of such hoardings by issue of licence in accordance with the rules
issued by the Governments This Act incidentally also became a compliance to
High Court direction while disposing of a batch of writ petitions directing
the Government to come out with a scheme to regulate such hoardings. However,
against this new legislation, certain persons filed writ petitions in the High
Court of Chennai and obtained stay for the provision relating to issue of
licence by urban local bodies. This case is still pending disposal by the High
Court.2\. While the State has thus not been able to successfully implement any
scheme tor regulating the hoardings, the Supreme Court, New Delhi has
delivered a judgement in the year 1998 directing the authorities to remove all
hoardings in Delhi which are on road sides and therefore are hazardous and
disturbance to safe traffic movement. The Government examined the whole case
of regulating hoardings in the light of this judgement of the Supreme Court
and have now decided to amend the Urban Local Bodies Acts in conformity with
the judgement of the Supreme Court.3\. Accordingly, the Government have
decided to amend the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (Tamil Nadu
Act IV of 1919), the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920 (Tamil Nadu
Act V of 1920), the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu
Act 15 of 1971), the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act, 1981 (Tamil
Nadu Act 25 of 19,81) and the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies Act, 1998 (Tamil
Nadu Act 9 of 1999) for the purpose to make a provision for removal of the
hoardings erected within municipal limits on public or private or municipal or
Government lands which are visible to the traffic on the road irrespective of
whether they are on the road side or not.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect to
the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 2 of the Tamil Nadu Government
