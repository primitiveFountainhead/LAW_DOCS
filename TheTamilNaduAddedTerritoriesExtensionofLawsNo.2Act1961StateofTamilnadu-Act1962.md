The Tamil Nadu (Added Territories) Extension of Laws (No. 2) Act, 1961Tamil
Nadu Act 39 of 1961Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Consequent on the
alteration of boundaries of the States of Madras and Andhra Pradesh under the
Andhra Pradesh and Madras (Alteration of Boundaries) Act, 1959 (Central Act56
of 1959), the territories specified in the Second Schedule to the said Act,
have been added on to this State from the State of Andhra Pradesh. By virtue
of section 45 of the said Act, the laws in force in the said territories
immediately before the 1st day of April 1960 will continue in force therein
until otherwise provided by a competent legislature or other competent
authority. By the Madras (Added Territory) Extension of Laws Act, 1961 (Madras
Act 9 of 1961), certain taxation measures relating to commercial taxes were
extended to the said territories. Again, the Madras Agricultural Income-tax
Act, 1955 (Madras Act V of 1955) has been extended to the said territories by
the Madras Agricultural Income-tax (Extension to Added Territory) Act, 1961
(Madras Act 11 of 1961). For the sake of securing uniformity in the laws in
force in the added territories and the rest of the State of Madras, it is now
proposed to extend to those territories certain other enactments in force in
the State of Madras and to repeal the corresponding laws in force in the said
territories.2\. The enactments specified in the First Schedule are proposed to
be extended without any modification. It will be seen from that Schedule that
it is proposed to extend to the said territories the Madras State Aid to
Industries Act, 1922 (Madras Act V of 1923), although that Act was in force in
those territories on the 1st October 1953, the date on which the State of
Andhra was formed and continues to be in force there. The extension of that
Act is intended to apply to those territories the amendments made by Madras
Act X of 1956 and to repeal the amendments made by Andhra Act XXXIII of 1956.
Similarly, the extension of the Madras Children Act, 1935 (Madras Act XX of
1935), and the Madras Public Health Act, 1939 (Madras Act III of 1939), is
intended to apply to the added territories, the amendments made to those Acts
after the 1st October 1953. The enactments specified in the Second Schedule
are proposed to be amended in their application to those territories so as to
being the provisions of those Acts into conformity with the provision of the
respective Acts as in force in the rest of the State. The enactments specified
in the Third Schedule are proposed to be repealed as they are considered no
longer necessary. The enactments specified in the Fourth Schedule are proposed
to be declared to be no part of the laws in force in the said territories.The
repeal and the declaration aforesaid are based on similar provisions contained
in the Madras Repealing and Amending Act, 1957 (Madras Act XXV of 1957),
according to which almost all the enactments referred to in the Third and the
Fourth Schedules have already been repealed or declared to be no longer in
force in the rest of the State.Published in Part-IV-Section 3 of the Fort St.
