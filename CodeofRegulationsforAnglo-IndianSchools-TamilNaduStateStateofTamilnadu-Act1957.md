case warrant.Such declaration shall not be made until the teacher or
Headmaster has been informed in writing of the charges against him and a full
enquiry has been made either by the Inspector of Anglo-Indian Schools or any
other officer deputed by the Director for the purpose, provided that this
procedure need not be followed in cases where the teacher or Headmaster has
been convicted by a competent Court.The nature of the enquiry to be conducted
will be as follows: - The Inspector of Anglo-Indian Schools should submit a
preliminary report to the Director in regard to the conduct or work of the
teacher or Headmaster. If the Director considers that a prima facie case has

to the teacher or Headmaster for his written explanation, which will be
obtained and submitted together with the remarks of the Correspondent and the
Inspector of Anglo-Indian Schools to the Director who will then issue suitable
orders considering the merits of each case. In the majority of cases, a

necessary.An appeal shall lie to the Government in respect of original orders
passed by the Director.Fees

grade and any special circumstances affecting the school or its pupils. In
cases where pupils attend the school only in the mornings or any limited
portion of the day, the management may charge proportionate fees for such
pupils, with the previous approval of the Inspector.A Special fee for medical
inspection shall be levied on the male pupils in Standards VI to X the amount

Appendix 4(Article 34)Instructions As To the Sanitary and Hygienic
Requirements to be Observed in the Designing and Construction of School
Buildings in the State of Tamil NaduSelection of Site

### 1\. In the selection of a site, the following point should be weighted
against considerations of economy, convenience, proximity to houses of
parents, etc: -

(i)A site should not be selected if its natural position is in a hollow or in
the neighbourhood of high trees or houses which prevent the free circulation
of air and the access of a sunlight to the school buildings. Shady trees are,
however, of value in the playground provided that they do not unduly reduce
the space available for play and are not planted so close to the school
buildings as to obstruct the entry of light into the class rooms or, in course
of time, to cause damage to the structure.(ii)Mud soil should be avoided and,
as far as possible, all soils which are specially retentive of
moisture.(iii)Sufficiency of space is important, and in this connection, the
possibility of future extension and the necessity of giving subsequent class
rooms, the proper orientation should be borne in mind.(iv)Channels and tanks
in the vicinity are disadvantage.(v)The presence of rank vegetation more
especially prickly pear is objectionable should, as far as possible, be
avoided.(vi)The neighbourhood of dusty and noisy roads and shops, mills or
factories should, as far as possible, is avoided.

### 2\. All site plans should show the nature of the surroundings the height
of the neighbouring buildings, the north point and the direction of the
prevailing wind.

Orientation of Buildings

### 3\. This will differ for different parts of the State and will depend
chiefly on the best way to secure perflation of air. Subject to this, the more
buildings are lighted from the north the better.

Floor Space

### 4\. When funds are available, they should be utilized in providing floor
space in excess of the following minimum requirements: -

For ordinary schools | 12 square feet per pupil  
---|---  
For training colleges and technical schools | 15 square feet per pupil  
  
Rooms which are intended to be used for practical work, such as laboratories,
drawing rooms, workshops, etc., should be carefully designed with a view to
the nature of the work and the number of pupils to be accommodated.Composition
of Floors

### 5\. It is desirable that the floors should be made of a material which
will admit of their being washed with water, stone flagging or something
better must be aimed at in rooms where desks or benches are provided.

Seating Arrangements

### 6\. The general principles which should govern the construction of desks
are Setforth in Annexure (i). Where duel desks are used, the desks may be
arranged most suitably as shown in diagram Annexure (ii).

### 7\. Forms without backs and desks are objectionable; type designs for
desks are issued by the department.

### 8\. Pupils should be seated in rows with the main light falling from the
left side, they should never face the light.

The same remark applies to the teachers.Windows

### 9\. Windows serve two purposes -

(a)Admission of light.(b)Admission of air.

### 10\. They should be placed at regular distances so as to ensure uniformity
of light and should either open outwards or be so hinged as to lie flat
against the walls.

### 11\. Window sills should not be more than 4 feet from the ground in rooms
in which the pupils are seated at desks. Windows for subsidiary lighting may
have their sills more than 4 feet from the floor.

### 12\. The window, area should not be less than one-fifth of the floor area
and wherever possible, the principal lighting should be from the north.

Doors

### 13\. Class rooms should not have to Be used as passages from one part of
the building to another. They should consequently not open into one another,
but into passage or verandah. No class room should have more than two doors
and in most cases one is preferable. The door or doors should be at the
teacher's end of the room and should open outwards.

Height of Class Rooms

### 14\. The minimum height of the room should be 12 feet to the tie beam when
the room has an open sloping roof and 14 feet to the under side of the joints,
where the room has terraced ceiling.

Ventilation

### 15\. Unless there are windows reaching to the top of the wall and capable
of being opened, ventilators are necessary near the top of the wall. The
ventilators should be regularly distributed in the same way as the windows.
For each pupil, 48 square inches of open ventilator should be provided.

Dimensions and Fittings of Class Rooms

### 16\. It is important that no school or class room should be more than 24'
in width or otherwise the rows of pupils will be too long to be properly
controlled by the teacher. The length of a room must depend on the number of
classes to be/held in it. In the case of a school divided into a number of
class rooms, the dimensions of any room should not exceed 23" x 25" that is an
approximate square. If it is admitted that a square is the best area for
teaching purposes, the length of a class room in a one-roomed school should
approximately close to some multiple of the width. Ample wall black-board
space should be provided especially on the wall at the teachers end of the
room which should be unbroken by doors, windows or cupboards. Cupboards

hanging freely down the edge of the desk next the body should be about an inch

mixed ages, there should be a large number of sizes).

### 5\. The desk must not be flat. It should slightly incline towards the
child at an angle of 100.

### 6\. The seat should not be flat, but saddle-shaped. Change of position
will be desirable.

more than 7 inches for younger children and not more than 10 inches for the
older ones.All seats should have proper backs so as to support the small of
the back upto the level of the shoulder blades.(vi)The minimum space for each
