the Secretary to Government in-charge of the department of Rural Development
and Local Administration shall be the Chairman of the Madras Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sewerage Board, ex officio. Now, for administrative
convenience the Rural Development and Local Administration Department has been
bifurcated into two Departments, namely, "Rural Development Department" and
"Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department". Consequent of the
bifurcation, the subject "Water supply" has been allocated to the Municipal
Administration and Water Supply Department. Hence the Government decided that
the Secretary to Government in-charge of the department dealing with the
subject water supply should be the Chairman of the said Board, ex-officio.2\.
Accordingly the Government decided to amend the Madras Metropolitan Water
Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1978). To give effect to
the above decision, the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1984 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 17 of 1984) was promulgated
by the Governor on the 11th September 1984 and the same was published in the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, Extraordinary, dated 13th September 1984. A
Bill to replace the said Ordinance was introduced in the Tamil Nadu
Legislative Assembly on the 11th October 1984. The said Bill could not be
taken up for consideration by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly because the
Assembly was adjourned sine die on the 15th October 1984 and both the Houses
of the Legislature were prorogue on the 31st October 1984. Subsequently, the
Legislative Assembly itself was dissolved with effect from the afternoon of
the 15th November 1984. Therefore, it became necessary to promulgate an
Ordinance again for the above purpose and the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply
and Sewerage (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 1984 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 22 of
1984) was promulgated by the Governor on the 19th November 1984 and the same
was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, Extraordinary, dated the
20th November 1984.3\. It has also been decided that there should be provision
in the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act
28 of 1978) to enable the Government to appoint in future even a non-official
as Chairman of the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board.
Necessary amendments in this regard have also been incorporated in the
Bill.4\. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance by an Act of the
Legislature and also to give effect to the above decision.Published in Part
IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the
20th March 1985.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras Metropolitan Water
Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Act, 1990 (Tamil Nadu Act 7 of 1990) - Section
4 of the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu
Act 28 of 1978) provides that the Secretary to Government in-charge of the
Department dealing with the subject "water-supply" shall be the Chairman of
the Board, ex-officio.2\. Section 4-A of the said Act also provides for the
appointment of a non-official as the Chairman of the Board in which event, the
Secretary K Government, in-charge of the Department dealing with the subject
"water-supply" shall function as a Director of the Board.3\. The Government
decided that an official other than the Secretary to Government in-charge of
the Department dealing with the subject "water supply" may also be appointed
as Chairman of the Board and to amend the said Act suitably for the above
purpose. Accordingly, the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1989 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 15 of 1989) was promulgated
by the Governor on the 27th December 1989 and the same was published in the
Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 29th December, 1989.4\.
The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of
the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 22nd January
1990.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and
Sewerage (Amendment) Act, 1992 (Tamil Nadu Act 6 of 1992). - Under the Madras
Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1978),
the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board is empowered to call
for tenders of all works and purchase of materials without any monetary limit
and settle the same. The Government in G. O. Ms. No. 310, Municipal
Administration and Water Supply Department, dated the 7th November 1991, have
ordered that tenders in respect of works and purchase of materials by the
Board, the cost of which exceeds one crore of rupees, should be approved by
the Government.2\. There is also no provision in the Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1978
empowering the Government to issue any direction to the Board for carrying out
the purposes of the Act.3\. In order to give a statutory footing to the orders
issued in the aforesaid Government Order and also to empower the Government to
give directions to the Board for carrying out the purposes of the Act, it has
been decided to amend the Act. Accordingly, the Madras Metropolitan Water
Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Ordinance, 1991 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 6 of
1991) was promulgated by the Governor.4\. It has now been decided that all
tenders in respect of any contract for the execution of any scheme, plan or
other work, or for the supply of any materials or goods the value of which
exceeds one crore of rupees, shall be finalised by the Government only and the
powers of the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board shall be
limited to that extent and to amend the Act suitably.5\. The Bill seeks to
replace the said Ordinance and to give effect to the above decision.Published
in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated
7 th February 1992.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Madras Metropolitan and
Water Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 41 of 1994). -
Water Supply and Sewerage Schemes in some portions of the Madras Metropolitan
Area are still being looked after by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage
Board. In order to have better co-ordination between the Madras Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sewerage Board and the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage
Board, it is considered necessary that the Managing Director, Tamil Nadu Water
Supply and Drainage Board shall also be a Director of Madras Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sewerage Board. The Government have, therefore, decided to
amend the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu
Act 28 of 1978) suitably for the above purpose.2\. The Bill seeks to give
effect to the above decision.Published in Part IV-Section 1 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated 3rd May 1994Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Act, 1996
(Tamil Nadu Act 35 of 1996). - Section 45(1)(a) of the Madras Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1978) provides that
the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, on the application by
the owner or occupier of any buildings or premises, arrange to supply water
thereto for domestic consumption and use, if such building or premises has an
annual value of more than three hundred rupees as assessed under section 35.
Similarly, section 56(l)(a) of the Act provides that the Board, on the
application of the owner or occupier of any premises or the owner of a private
street, arrange for the applicant's house-sewer or other sewer in the private
street to empty into a sewer of the Board if the premises or of the property
in which the private street is situated is assessed to an annual value of not
less than three hundred rupees as assessed under section 35.2\. In Madras
City, there are some private streets which have not been handed over to the
Corporation of Madras. Further, there are some buildings and premises wherein
the assessed annual value is less than rupees three hundred. In view of the
restrictions based on the annual value of the buildings as provided in
sections 45(l)(a) and 56(l)(a) of the Act, the Madras Metropolitan Water
Supply and Sewerage Board is not in a position to give water and sewer
connections to these buildings and premises. The sewage from these buildings
flow on the streets and then into storm water drains causing health hazard.
Most of these buildings and premises belong to weaker sections and down rodden
in the city. In the interest of the public, Government have now decided to
amend sections 45(1)(a) and 56(1)(a) of the Act so as to enable the Board to
give water and sewer facilities to all buildings and premises in the Madras
city irrespective of the assessed annual value of their buildings and
premises.3\. Section 40-A provides that where any contract for the execution
of any scheme, plan or other work or for the supply of any materials or goods
the value of which exceeds one crore of rupees, the Board, on receipt of the
tenders shall place it before the Government which may approve any tender
which appears to them upon a review of all the circumstances, to be the most
advantageous and thereupon the Board shall accept the tender so approved.
Government have, now, decided to omit section 40-A of the said Act.4\. The
Bill seeks to give effect to the above decisions.Published in Part IV-Section
1 of the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, 24th August
1996.Statement of Objects and Reasons - Chennai Metropolitan Area Ground Water
(Regulation) Amendment Act, 1997 (Tamil Nadu Act 29 of 1997). - The Committee
on Delegated Legislation (1991-92) of the Tenth Assembly in its third report
has recommended for collection of fees issue of licences, permits, etc., under
the Chennai Metropolitan Area Groundwater (Regulation) Act, 1987 (Tamil Nadu
Act 27 of 1987).2\. The Government, accepting the recommendations of the said
Committee have decided to prescribe fees for granting of permit to sink well,
for registering of existing wells and use of ground water of such wells, for
granting of licence for extraction, use or transport of ground water in the
city of Chennai and the villages specified in the Schedule to the said Tamil
Nadu Act 27 of 1987 and also for appeals against such issue of licence under

Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 28 of 1978), provides that the Secretary to
Government in charge of the department dealing with the subject "water supply"
shall be in Chairman of the Board, ex-officio. The Government have now decided

basis on which taxes shall be levied, etc. making, maintaining and regulating
connections for the supply of water and fees for connection and reconnection
and the term and amount payable for connection of house-sewers, etc. and the
basis of levying the charge of providing for sewerage service without water-
supply, should obtain the previous sanction of the Government. Now, the
Government have also decided that the Board shall be given autonomy in respect
of revision, of taxes and charges. Accordingly, it has been decided to amend
the said Act suitably.3\. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above
decision.Published in Part IV-section 1 of the Tamil Nadu Government of
Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 14th October 1992.Statement of Objects and
Reasons - Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage (Second Amendment)
Act, 1997 (Tamil Nadu Act 58 of 1997). - At present there is no provision in
the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act,
28 of 1978) for the appointment of a Technical Director as one of the
Directors of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. The
Government have now decided to appoint a Technical Director in consultation

Water Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Act, 1998 (Tamil Nadu Act 30 of 1998). -
Hitherto, the property tax in the municipalities and corporations is levied
based on the annual value of the building. Since this system of levying the
property tax leads to the arbitrary assessment and malpractices, the
Government evolved a new and scientific method of assessment of property tax
on the basis of the carpet area of the building, its location, type of
construction, its use and age of the building. Accordingly, amendments were
made to all Acts relating to the Urban local bodies.2\. The Chennai
Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board now collects seven per cent of
the annual rental value as water tax. In as much as the property tax is not to
be levied on the basis of rental value, it has been decided to levy not
exceeding thirty-five per cent of the property tax as water tax and not
exceeding fifteen per cent of the property tax as sewerage tax.3\.
Accordingly, the Government have decided to amend the Chennai Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1978 suitably.4\. The Bill seeks to give effect
